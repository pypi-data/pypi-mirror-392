"""Abstract interfaces for observation simulators.

This module defines the abstract base classes and interfaces for observation
simulators used in Monte Carlo Cross-Simulation (MCOS). These simulators generate
synthetic observations of financial data for robust backtesting and uncertainty
analysis of portfolio optimization algorithms.

Key components:
- AbstractObservationSimulator: Base class for all simulators
- Standardized observation generation interface
- Asset name preservation guarantees
- Integration with MCOS framework
- Type-safe observation data structures

    """Abstract base class for generating synthetic observations with asset name preservation.

    Observation simulators are used in Monte Carlo Cross-Simulation (MCOS) to generate
    multiple realizations of expected returns and covariance matrices for robust
    backtesting and uncertainty quantification.

    All simulators maintain asset name consistency between input and output, enabling
    seamless integration with pandas-based optimizers and workflows.

    Examples:
        Basic simulation with asset name preservation:

        >>> simulator = MuCovObservationSimulator(mu, cov, n_observations=252)
        >>> mu_sim, cov_sim, prices_sim, time_sim, l_moments_sim = simulator.get_sample()
        >>> print("Original assets:", mu.index.tolist())
        >>> print("Simulated assets:", mu_sim.index.tolist())
        >>> # Asset names are preserved across simulations

        Use in MCOS workflow:

        >>> for i in range(n_simulations):
        ...     mu_sim, cov_sim, prices_sim, time_sim, l_moments_sim = simulator.get_sample()
        ...     weights = optimizer.allocate(mu_sim, cov_sim, prices_sim, time_sim, l_moments_sim)
        ...     # All operations preserve asset names

        Note:

            This enables seamless chaining with optimizers and other pandas-aware components.
