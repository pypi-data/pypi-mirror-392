"""Synthetic data generation for portfolio optimization training.

This package provides utilities for generating synthetic covariance matrices
and training data for machine learning-based portfolio optimization algorithms.
It includes tools for creating diverse, realistic covariance matrix samples
that can be used to train autoencoders and other ML models.

Key features:
- Synthetic covariance matrix generation with controlled properties
- Diverse training dataset creation (30k and 5k sample datasets)
- Lower triangle matrix utilities for covariance representation
- Autoencoder training data preparation
- Realistic financial market simulation
