"""Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) portfolio optimization.

This package implements Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithms for
portfolio optimization. SQP is an iterative method for nonlinear constrained
optimization that solves a sequence of quadratic programming subproblems.

Key features:
- Nonlinear constrained optimization
- Higher-order moment optimization (skewness, kurtosis)
- Risk parity optimization
- Robust moment estimation with exponential moving averages
- Multi-start optimization for better convergence
