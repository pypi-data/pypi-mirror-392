"""Nested Clustered Optimization (NCO) for portfolio allocation.

This package implements Nested Clustered Optimization, a hierarchical
approach that combines clustering with optimization. Assets are first
grouped into clusters, then optimized within and across clusters to
achieve better diversification.

Key features:
- Hierarchical clustering of assets
- Intra-cluster and inter-cluster optimization
- Improved diversification through clustering
- Sharpe ratio maximization within nested structure
- Integration with scikit-learn clustering
