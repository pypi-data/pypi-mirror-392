"""Naive portfolio allocation strategies.

This module implements simple baseline portfolio allocation strategies that
serve as benchmarks for more sophisticated optimization algorithms. These
strategies provide equal weighting or other simple allocation rules.

Key optimizers:
- EqualWeightOptimizer: Equal allocation across all assets
- Simple rule-based allocation strategies
- Benchmark strategies for performance comparison
- Minimal computational complexity approaches

    """Equal-weight portfolio optimizer with pandas interface.

    Implements the simplest possible allocation strategy by assigning equal weights
    to all available assets (1/N strategy). Despite its simplicity, this approach
    often serves as a strong benchmark against more sophisticated optimization methods.

    Key Features:
        - Assigns equal weights to all assets: weight_i = 1/N for all i
        - No optimization required - deterministic allocation
        - Robust to estimation errors in expected returns and covariance
        - Fast execution with O(1) complexity
        - Asset names preserved from input to output

    Examples:
        Basic usage with asset name preservation:

        >>> optimizer = NaiveOptimizer()
        >>> weights = optimizer.allocate(mu, cov)
        >>> print(f"Equal weight per asset: {1/len(weights):.4f}")

        ...     print(f"{asset}: {weight:.4f}")

        GOOGL: 0.2500
        MSFT: 0.2500
        TSLA: 0.2500

        Access asset information:

        >>> asset_names = weights.index.tolist()
        >>> n_assets = len(weights)
        >>> print(f"Portfolio contains {n_assets} assets: {asset_names}")
