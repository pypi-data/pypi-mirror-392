"""Naive and momentum-based portfolio allocation strategies.

This package provides simple baseline allocation strategies including
equal weighting, momentum-based allocation, and other naive approaches
that serve as benchmarks for more sophisticated optimization methods.

Key strategies:
- Equal weight allocation across all assets
- Momentum-based allocation (recent winners)
- Naive risk parity approximations
- Simple benchmark strategies for comparison
