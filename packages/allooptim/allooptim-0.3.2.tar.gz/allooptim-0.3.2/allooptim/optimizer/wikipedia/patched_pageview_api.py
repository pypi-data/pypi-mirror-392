"""Patch for pageviewapi to ensure compatibility with Python 3.10+.

The pageviewapi library relies on collections attributes that were
moved in Python 3.10+. This patch adds the missing attributes back to
the collections module.

This is a monkey patch and should be used with caution.
Remove as soon as the base library is updated to support Python 3.10+ natively.
