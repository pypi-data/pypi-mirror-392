    Performs a single measurement of network parameters with fail-safe protection.

    The method initiates a standard measurement cycle via YaSpeedTest.run() and returns
    the result in SpeedResult format. A built-in safe exception handling mechanism is enabled: any network errors, connection breaks, timeouts, or
    internal client exceptions do not cause the calling code to crash.

    If successful, the actual values are returned:
    — ping_ms
    — download_mbps
    — upload_mbps

    If any error occurs, the method returns a safe fallback packet:
    SpeedResult(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

    This mechanism allows run_single_test to be used in stress tests,
    large-scale parallel checks, and monitoring scenarios,
    where stability is more important than the accuracy of a single measurement.

    Conducts a parallel stress test of a network client, simulating high load
    and verifying the stability of throughput measurement algorithms.

    The test runs 30 simultaneous speed measurements (ping, download, upload)
    on a single YaSpeedTest instance. The goal is to validate:

    * correct client operation under concurrent requests;
    * absence of performance degradation;
    * absence of data races and side effects;
    * stability of returned metrics (all values ​​are non-negative);
    * absence of outliers exceeding permissible physical limits (<= 20,000 Mbps).

    Upon completion, the test aggregates:
    — average ping value;
    — average download and upload speeds;
    — minimum and maximum values ​​for sanity-check.

    The test does not verify the accuracy of actual network speeds: it ensures
    that the client scales correctly and reliably processes massive concurrent calls.
