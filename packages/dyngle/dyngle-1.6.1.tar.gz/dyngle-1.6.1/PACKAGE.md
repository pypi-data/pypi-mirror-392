# Dyngle

An experimantal, lightweight, easily configurable workflow engine for
automating development, operations, data processing, and content management
tasks.

Technical foundations

- Configuration, task definition, and flow control in YAML
- Operations as system commands using a familiar shell-like syntax
- Expressions and logic in pure Python

## Quick installation (MacOS)

```bash
brew install python@3.11
python3.11 -m pip install pipx
pipx install dyngle
```

## Getting started

Create a file `.dyngle.yml`:

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    hello:
      - echo "Hello world"
```

Run an operation:

```bash
dyngle run hello
```

## Configuration

Dyngle reads configuration from YAML files. Specify the config file location using any of the following (in order of precedence):

1. A `--config` command line option, OR
2. A `DYNGLE_CONFIG` environment variable, OR
3. `.dyngle.yml` in current directory, OR
4. `~/.dyngle.yml` in home directory

## Operations

Operations are defined under `dyngle:` in the configuration. In its simplest form, an Operation is a YAML array defining the Steps, as system commands with space-separated arguments. In that sense, a Dyngle operation looks something akin to a phony Make target, a short Bash script, or a CI/CD job.

As a serious example, consider the `init` operation from the Dyngle configuration delivered with the project's source code.

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    init:
      - rm -rf .venv
      - python3.11 -m venv .venv
      - .venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip poetry
```

The elements of the YAML array _look_ like lines of Bash, but Dyngle processes them directly as system commands, allowing for template substitution and Python expression evaluation (described below). So shell-specific syntax such as `|`, `>`, and `$VARIABLE` won't work.

## Data and Templates

Dyngle maintains a block of "Live Data" throughout an operation, which is a set of named values (Python `dict`, YAML "mapping"). The values are usually strings but can also be other data types that are valid in both YAML and Python.

The `dyngle run` command feeds the contents of stdin to the Operation as Data, by converting a YAML mapping to named Python values. The values may be substituted into commands or arguments in Steps using double-curly-bracket syntax (`{{` and `}}`) similar to Jinja2.

For example, consider the following configuration:

``` yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    hello:
      - echo "Hello {{name}}!"
```

Cram some YAML into stdin to try it in your shell:

```bash
echo "name: Francis" | dyngle run hello
```

The output will say:

```text
Hello Francis!
```

## Expressions

Operations may contain Expressions, written in Python, that can be referenced in Operation Step Templates using the same syntax as for Data. In the case of a naming conflict, an Expression takes precedence over Data with the same name. Expressions can reference names in the Data directly.

Expressions may be defined in either of two ways in the configuration:

1. Global Expressions, under the `dyngle:` mapping, using the `expressions:` key.
2. Local Expressions, within a single Operation, in which case the Steps of the operation require a `steps:` key.

Here's an example of a global Expression

```yaml
dyngle:
  expressions:
    count: len(name)    
  operations:
    say-hello:
      - echo "Hello {{name}}! Your name has {{count}} characters."
```

For completeness, consider the following example using a local Expression for the same purpose.

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    say-hello:
      expressions:
        count: len(name)
      steps:
        - echo "Hello {{name}}! Your name has {{count}} characters."
```

Expressions can use a controlled subset of the Python standard library, including:

- Built-in data types such as `str()`
- Essential built-in functions such as `len()`
- The core modules from the `datetime` package (but some methods such as `strftime()` will fail)
- A specialized function called `formatted()` to perform string formatting operations on a `datetime` object
- A restricted version of `Path()` that only operates within the current working directory
- Various other useful utilities, mostly read-only, such as the `math` module
- A special function called `resolve` which resolves data expressions using the same logic as in templates
- An array `args` containing arguments passed to the `dyngle run` command after the Operation name

**NOTE** Some capabilities of the Expression namespace might be limited in the future. The goal is support purely read-only operations within Expressions.

Expressions behave like functions that take no arguments, using the Data as a namespace. So Expressions reference Data directly as local names in Python.

YAML keys can contain hyphens, which are fully supported in Dyngle. To reference a hyphenated key in an Expression, choose:

- Reference the name using underscores instead of hyphens (they are automatically replaced), OR
- Use the built-in special-purpose `resolve()` function (which can also be used to reference other expressions)

```yaml
dyngle:
  expressions:
    say-hello: >-
        'Hello ' + full_name + '!'
```

... or using the `resolve()` function, which also allows expressions to essentially call other expressions, using the same underlying data set.

```yaml
dyngle:
  expressions:
    hello: >-
        'Hello ' + resolve('formal-name') + '!'
    formal-name: >-
        'Ms. ' + full_name
```

Note it's also _possible_ to call other expressions by name as functions, if they only return hard-coded values (i.e. constants).

```yaml
dyngle:
  expressions:
    author-name: Francis Potter
    author-hello: >-
        'Hello ' + author_name()
``` 

Here are some slightly more sophisticated exercises using Expression reference syntax:

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    reference-hyphenated-data-key:
      expressions:
        spaced-name: "' '.join([x for x in first_name])"
        count-name: len(resolve('first-name'))
        x-name: "'X' * int(resolve('count-name'))"
      steps:
        - echo "Your name is {{first-name}} with {{count-name}} characters, but I will call you '{{spaced-name}}' or maybe '{{x-name}}'"
    reference-expression-using-function-syntax:
      expressions:
        name: "'George'"
        works: "name()"
        double: "name * 2"
        fails: double()
      steps:
        - echo "It works to call you {{works}}"
        # - echo "I have trouble calling you {{fails}}"
```

Finally, here's an example using args:

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    name-from-arg:
      expressions:
        name: "args[0]"
      steps:
        - echo "Hello {{name}}"
```

## Passing values between Steps in an Operation

The Steps parser supports two special operators designed to move data between Steps in an explicit way.

- The data assignment operator (`=>`) assigns the contents of stdout from the command to an element in the data
- The data input operator (`->`) assigns the value of an element in the data (or an evaluated expression) to stdin for the command

The operators must appear in order in the step and must be isolated with whitespace, i.e.

```
<input-variable-name> -> <command and arguments> => <output-variable-name>
```

Here we get into more useful functionality, where commands can be strung together in meaningful ways without the need for Bash.

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    weather:
      - curl -s "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current_weather=true" => weather-data
      - weather-data -> jq -j '.current_weather.temperature' => temperature
      - echo "It's {{temperature}} degrees out there!"
```

If names overlap, data items populated using the data assignment operator take precedence over expressions and data in the original input from the beginning of the Operation.

## Sub-operations

Operations can call other operations as steps using the `sub:` key. This allows for composability and reuse of operation logic.

Basic example:

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    greet:
      - echo "Hello!"
    
    greet-twice:
      steps:
        - sub: greet
        - sub: greet
```

Sub-operations can accept arguments using the `args:` key. The called operation can access these via the `args` array in expressions:

```yaml
dyngle:
  operations:
    greet-person:
      expressions:
        person: "args[0]"
      steps:
        - echo "Hello, {{person}}!"
    
    greet-team:
      steps:
        - sub: greet-person
          args: ['Alice']
        - sub: greet-person
          args: ['Bob']
```

### Scoping Rules

Sub-operations follow clear scoping rules that separate **declared values** from **live data**:

**Declared Values are Locally Scoped:**
- Values and expressions declared via `values:` or `expressions:` keys are local to each operation
- A parent operation's declared values are NOT visible to child sub-operations
- A child sub-operation's declared values do NOT leak to the parent operation
- Each operation only sees its own declared values plus global declared values

**Live Data is Globally Shared:**
- Data assigned via the `=>` operator persists across all operations
- Live data populated by a sub-operation IS available to the parent after the sub-operation completes
- This allows operations to communicate results through shared mutable state

Example demonstrating scoping:

```yaml
dyngle:
  values:
    declared-val: global
  
  operations:
    child:
      values:
        declared-val: child-local
      steps:
        - echo {{declared-val}}  # Outputs "child-local"
        - echo "result" => live-data
    
    parent:
      steps:
        - echo {{declared-val}}  # Outputs "global"
        - sub: child
        - echo {{declared-val}}  # Still outputs "global"
        - echo {{live-data}}     # Outputs "result" (persisted from child)
```

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an operation is:

1. Load Data if it exists from YAML on stdin (if no tty)
2. Find the named Operation in the configuration
2. Perform template rendering on the first Step, using Data and Expressions
3. Execute the Step in a subprocess, passing in an input value and populating an output value in the Data
4. Continue with the next Step

Note that operations in the config are _not_ full shell lines. They are passed directly to the system.

## Imports

Configuration files can import other configuration files, by providing an entry `imports:` with an array of filepaths. The most obvious example is a Dyngle config in a local directory which imports the user-level configuration.

```yaml
dyngle:
  imports:
    - ~/.dyngle.yml
  expressions:
  operations:
```

In the event of item name conflicts, expressions and operations are loaded from imports in the order specified, so imports lower in the array will override those higher up. The expressions and operations defined in the main file override the imports. Imports are not recursive.

## Security

Commands are executed using Python's `subprocess.run()` with arguments split in a shell-like fashion. The shell is not used, which reduces the likelihood of shell injection attacks. However, note that Dyngle is not robust to malicious configuration. Use with caution.
