           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Grafana FastMCP Server / CLI
## Visão geral
Python FastMCP Server / CLI ( OpenAI Compliance ), com suporte a transportes Server-Sent Events (SSE), Streamable HTTP e STDIO. A aplicação expõe recursos de uma instância Grafana para agentes compatíveis com o protocolo MCP, oferecendo operações para busca, criação e atualização de dashboards, exploração de logs via Loki, consulta de datasources, gestão de alertas, incidentes, turnos de on-call e acesso a dados de observabilidade (Prometheus, Pyroscope, Grafana Sift e muito mais).

**🚀 NOVA VERSÃO v1.2.3**: Esta release inclui melhorias nas checagens de inicialização (TLS/autenticação), suporte a variáveis TLS/SSL e flags CLI para troubleshooting rápido. Veja [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) e [ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md) para detalhes completos.

## Estrutura do projeto
Todo o código-fonte fica no diretório `app/`, deixando a raiz do repositório reservada para arquivos de configuração (como `.env`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` e este `README`). A organização completa é:

```

```

Consulte [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) para detalhes das versões publicadas.

Cada submódulo em `app/tools/` registra um conjunto de ferramentas MCP, abrangendo desde administração de usuários até consultas de observabilidade e automação de incidentes.

## Requisitos
- Python 3.13 ou superior
- Instância Grafana acessível (local ou remota) e credenciais de API válidas


### Gerenciamento de dependências (uv/uvx)
Este repositório adota o [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) como gerenciador de dependências e execução. Você pode continuar usando `venv`/`pip` tradicionalmente, mas recomendamos `uv` pelos benefícios de velocidade, reprodutibilidade (`uv.lock`) e simplificação de scripts.

**Dependências não são pinadas**: O projeto sempre buscará as versões mais recentes compatíveis de cada pacote. O arquivo `uv.lock` é versionado para garantir builds reprodutíveis e CI estável.

Passos rápidos:

1. Instale o uv (uma vez):
```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Sincronize as dependências (runtime + dev):
```bash
uv sync --dev --all-extras
```

3. Rode o servidor:
```bash
uv run -m app --address localhost:8000 --log-level INFO --transport stdio
```

Também é possível executar via PyPI usando uvx (após a publicação):
```bash
uvx grafana-fastmcp --address localhost:8000 --log-level INFO --transport stdio
```

4. Comandos comuns:
```bash
# Testes
uv run pytest

# Cobertura
uv run pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing

# Lint e formatação (ruff)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Type checking
uv run mypy app tests

# Empacotar com PyInstaller
uvx pyinstaller --clean --onefile --name grafana-mcp run_app.py
```


**Testes unitários:**
- O badge "PR Tests (3.13)" acima reflete o status dos testes que rodarão para cada Pull Request (Python 3.13).
- O badge "Python package" reflete o status do pipeline principal (push para main).
- Para rodar localmente com uv/uvx:
  - `uv run pytest` (unitários)
  - `uv run pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing` (cobertura)
  - `make uv-test` (atalho Makefile)
  - `make uv-cov` (cobertura via Makefile)

**Construção de artefatos em PRs:**
- Para gerar binários/wheel no contexto de um PR, adicione o rótulo `build-artifacts` ao PR. Isso acionará o job `build-artifacts` que constrói e anexa os artefatos ao workflow como `pr-build-artifacts`.

**Atualize o lockfile**: Ao atualizar/alterar pacotes, rode `uv lock` para garantir builds determinísticos.

## Configuração
A aplicação lê os parâmetros de conexão a partir de variáveis de ambiente, argumentos de linha de comando ou cabeçalhos HTTP. As principais variáveis disponíveis em `app/config.py` são:

- `GRAFANA_URL`: URL base da instância Grafana (padrão `http://localhost:3000`).
- `GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`: token de service account recomendado.
- `GRAFANA_API_KEY`: chave de API legada (use apenas se não houver service account).
- `GRAFANA_USERNAME` / `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`: credenciais para autenticação básica.
- `GRAFANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `GRAFANA_ID_TOKEN`: tokens OIDC utilizados quando disponíveis.

Defina as variáveis conforme o método de autenticação que estiver usando. Também é possível fornecer certificados TLS personalizados por meio da estrutura `TLSConfig` definida no módulo de configuração.

TLS / SSL (novas variáveis)
 - `GRAFANA_TLS_CERT_FILE`: caminho para certificado cliente (opcional)
 - `GRAFANA_TLS_KEY_FILE`: caminho para chave do certificado (opcional)
 - `GRAFANA_TLS_CA_FILE`: caminho para um bundle CA para validar o servidor Grafana (opcional)
 - `GRAFANA_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY`: se `true` (ou `1`, `yes`), ignora a verificação do certificado TLS (útil para certificados auto-assinados; inseguro)

Além das variáveis de ambiente, agora existem três flags CLI úteis:
 - `--ignore-ssl`: equivalente a definir `GRAFANA_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY=true` — faz o cliente ignorar erros de certificado.
 - `--check-connection`: executa uma verificação simples (`/api/health`) contra a instância Grafana e encerra com código 0 em sucesso ou 2 em falha. Útil para CI ou troubleshooting pré-execução.
 - `--require-grafana`: quando fornecida, a aplicação executa um conjunto de checagens na inicialização — reachability/TLS via `/api/health`, validação de identidade do servidor, e verificação de autenticação via `/api/user` — e aborta o startup se algum passo falhar.
 - `--require-grafana` (enabled by default): a aplicação executará um conjunto de checagens na inicialização (reachability/TLS via `/api/health`, validação de identidade do servidor, e verificação de autenticação via `/api/user`) e abortará a inicialização se alguma checagem falhar. Para desativar esse comportamento padrão, passe `--no-require-grafana`.

## Execução
Após configurar o ambiente, execute o servidor MCP com:

```bash
python -m app --address localhost:8000 --log-level INFO
```

Por padrão, o transporte STDIO é utilizado. Para executar em modos HTTP, informe `--transport sse` ou `--transport streamable-http` conforme necessário.

Se existir um arquivo `.env` na raiz do projeto, ele será carregado automaticamente durante a inicialização. Para utilizar um arquivo diferente, passe `--env-file caminho/para/arquivo`.
Além disso, variáveis de ambiente como `APP_ADDRESS`, `BASE_PATH`, `STREAMABLE_HTTP_PATH`, `LOG_LEVEL` e `TRANSPORT` são usadas como valores padrão para os respectivos parâmetros CLI quando definidos. Para alterar o prompt inicial fornecido aos clientes MCP, edite `instructions.md` ou defina `MCP_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH` apontando para outro arquivo de texto/Markdown.

Parâmetros úteis:
- `--address`: endereço e porta nos quais o servidor será publicado.
- `--base-path`: caminho base para expor o transporte HTTP (padrão `/`).
- `--streamable-http-path`: caminho do endpoint Streamable HTTP (padrão `mcp`; aceita valores absolutos ou relativos ao `--base-path`).
- `--transport`: transporte MCP a utilizar (`sse`, `streamable-http` ou `stdio`; padrão `stdio`).
- `--log-level`: nível de log (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, etc.).
- `--debug`: ativa modo de depuração do FastMCP.
- `--version`: imprime a versão da aplicação e encerra.
 - `--version`: imprime a versão da aplicação e encerra.
- `--env-file`: caminho para um arquivo `.env` adicional a ser carregado antes da inicialização.

O servidor registra automaticamente todas as ferramentas MCP descritas em `app/tools/` através da função `register_all`. Agentes MCP podem consumir as capacidades para listar datasources, atualizar dashboards, executar consultas no Loki e gerar links de navegação no Grafana, entre outras.

Também é possível sobrescrever as credenciais do Grafana diretamente pela CLI, utilizando os mesmos nomes das variáveis de ambiente, por exemplo:

```bash
python -m app --address localhost:5501 --GRAFANA_URL http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
  --GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN glsa_example_token
```

### Conformidade com a especificação MCP da OpenAI
Esta implementação segue os requisitos publicados em [platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#create-an-mcp-server](https://platform.openai.com/docs/mcp#create-an-mcp-server):

- As ações `search` e `search_dashboards` expõem somente o parâmetro obrigatório `query`, tipado como `string`.
- A ação `fetch` exige apenas o parâmetro `id`, também tipado como `string`, mantendo campos opcionais (`uid`, `url`, etc.) para enriquecer o contexto sem ferir a especificação.
- Os transportes SSE, Streamable HTTP e STDIO respeitam os caminhos e formatos esperados pelo conector MCP da OpenAI e podem ser montados em um `base_path` customizado.
- O servidor publica metadados (`instructions`, lista de ferramentas e schemas JSON) diretamente do `FastMCP`, assegurando compatibilidade com clientes que validam o contrato MCP.

## Makefile
O repositório disponibiliza um `Makefile` com alvos que agilizam as tarefas mais comuns de desenvolvimento. O alvo padrão (`make`) executa `make help`, listando um resumo dos principais comandos disponíveis.

### Ambiente local
- `make venv`: cria o ambiente virtual e instala as dependências listadas em `requirements.txt`.
- `make local`: inicia o servidor MCP utilizando o virtualenv criado; o comando lê automaticamente variáveis definidas em `.env`.
- `make package`: gera um executável único (`dist/grafana-mcp`) via PyInstaller.

Variáveis como `APP_ADDRESS`, `BASE_PATH`, `STREAMABLE_HTTP_PATH`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `TRANSPORT` e `ENV_FILE` podem ser sobrescritas diretamente na linha de comando (`make run-local APP_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:9000 TRANSPORT=streamable-http STREAMABLE_HTTP_PATH=/stream`).

Após executar `make package`, o binário resultante pode ser distribuído como comando único, sem depender do Python local ou do virtualenv. Os assets e dependências Python são incorporados pelo PyInstaller.

### Atalhos com uv/uvx
Se preferir usar `uv`, os mesmos fluxos estão mapeados em alvos Make:

- `make uv-sync` — instala/atualiza dependências (inclui grupos de dev)
- `make uv-local` — executa o servidor com `uv run`
- `make uv-test` — executa testes
- `make uv-cov` — executa testes com cobertura
- `make uv-lint` — ruff check
- `make uv-fmt` — ruff format
- `make uv-typecheck` — mypy
- `make uv-package` — empacota com `uvx pyinstaller`
- `make uv-lock` — atualiza o `uv.lock`

### Containers
- `make docker` / `make podman`: empacotam a aplicação em uma imagem Docker ou Podman.

Os alvos de containers respeitam variáveis como `IMAGE_NAME`, `CONTAINER_NAME`, `APP_PORT`, `TRANSPORT` e `ENV_FILE`, permitindo adaptar os comandos ao seu fluxo de trabalho.

## Testes automatizados

O projeto utiliza `pytest` para validar fluxos críticos como carregamento de configuração, leitura das instruções padrão, negociação do transporte Streamable HTTP e ferramentas MCP para buscas e Grafana Asserts. Para rodar a suíte localmente:

1. Com uv: `make uv-sync && make uv-test`
2. Com venv/pip: crie (ou atualize) o ambiente virtual com `make venv` e execute `pytest`.
3. Execute `pytest` na raiz do repositório para disparar os 197 testes atuais.

O comando também está disponível via `python -m pytest` caso prefira não expor o executável instalado no virtualenv. Mantê-lo em dia ajuda a garantir compatibilidade contínua com os conectores MCP suportados.

### Cobertura de testes com `pytest-cov`

Para gerar relatórios de cobertura, instale o plugin opcional `pytest-cov` dentro do virtualenv e execute a suíte com a flag `--cov`:

```bash
# via uv
uv run pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing

# via pip/venv
pip install pytest pytest-cov
pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing
```

A execução atual produz um resumo com cobertura global de aproximadamente **85%**, destacando pontos fortes como `app/config.py` (85%), `app/instructions.py` (93%) e `app/tools/search.py` (90%). Versões anteriores introduziram testes abrangentes para todas as ferramentas corrigidas, melhorando significativamente a cobertura geral do projeto.

## Ferramentas disponíveis

As tools com **resposta consolidada** incluem campos como `total_count`, `type` e preservam os dados originais para máxima compatibilidade com streamable HTTP.

## Transportes MCP suportados

> **✨ Compatibilidade Total com ChatGPT/OpenAI**: A versão 1.1.0 introduziu respostas consolidadas que eliminam completamente problemas de chunking JSON em streamable HTTP, proporcionando experiência perfeita com ChatGPT/OpenAI.

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
O servidor publica um endpoint SSE capaz de manter uma conexão HTTP aberta para envio de eventos do servidor para o cliente. Ao executar `python -m app --transport sse`, o FastMCP monta dois caminhos principais:

1. `GET /sse`: inicializa a sessão SSE, retornando `Content-Type: text/event-stream` e enviando eventos `message`, `ping` e `response` conforme o protocolo MCP.
2. `POST /messages/`: recebe mensagens do cliente com prompts, chamadas de ferramenta ou confirmações. Cada payload é correlacionado por ID e as respostas são emitidas pela conexão SSE aberta.

Esse fluxo permite que plataformas de IA ou agentes MCP recebam respostas em streaming enquanto enviam comandos de maneira independente. O caminho base pode ser customizado via `--base-path` (por exemplo, `/grafana` expõe o SSE em `/grafana/sse` e o endpoint de mensagens em `/grafana/messages/`).

### Streamable HTTP
Com `python -m app --transport streamable-http`, o servidor expõe um único endpoint HTTP compatível com o transporte Streamable HTTP do MCP. Por padrão, o caminho é `/mcp`, mas ele pode ser ajustado com `--streamable-http-path` (valores relativos respeitam o `--base-path`). Esse modo é útil para clientes que preferem uma API HTTP tradicional, mantendo suporte a respostas parciais via streaming.

**🚀 Histórico — v1.1.0**: Todas as tools da v1.1.0 retornam respostas consolidadas que eliminam problemas de chunking JSON, proporcionando:
- ✅ **Performance 90% melhor** em operações de listagem
- ✅ **Zero timeouts** por fragmentação de resposta
- ✅ **Sessões estáveis** sem perda de conexão
- ✅ **Compatibilidade 100%** com ChatGPT/OpenAI

Para investigações ou buscas longas, ajuste os timeouts padrão do servidor HTTP definindo variáveis de ambiente antes de iniciar o processo:

- `MCP_STREAMABLE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_KEEP_ALIVE` (padrão `65` segundos)
- `MCP_STREAMABLE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_NOTIFY` (padrão `120` segundos)
- `MCP_STREAMABLE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN` (padrão igual ao maior valor entre o notify e `120` segundos)

Valores maiores evitam que clientes MCP desconectem durante respostas demoradas, aproximando-se da robustez observada no transporte SSE.

### STDIO
O transporte STDIO (`python -m app --transport stdio`) permite executar o servidor como um processo filho de um agente, comunicando-se por entrada e saída padrão. Não há endpoints HTTP nesse modo, tornando-o ideal para integrações locais ou ambientes restritos.

## Integração com Claude
Claude Desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux) já reconhece os três transportes publicados por este servidor. Basta adicionar um bloco em `claude_desktop_config.json` com o comando desejado, o transporte correspondente e as variáveis de ambiente apontando para a sua instância Grafana.

### SSE (streaming bidirecional)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana-sse": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "app",
        "--address", "127.0.0.1:8000",
        "--transport", "sse"
      ],
      "transport": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse",
        "messagesUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/messages/"
      },
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "https://grafana.example.com",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "glsa_example_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Nesse modo, Claude consome respostas em streaming pela sessão SSE enquanto envia comandos HTTP independentes para o endpoint de mensagens.

### Streamable HTTP (endpoint único)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana-http": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m", "app",
        "--address", "127.0.0.1:8100",
        "--transport", "streamable-http",
        "--streamable-http-path", "mcp"
      ],
      "transport": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8100/mcp",
        "streaming": true
      },
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "https://grafana.example.com",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "glsa_example_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Claude enviará todas as requisições MCP para o único endpoint configurado, recebendo respostas parciais usando o modo Streamable HTTP do FastMCP.

### STDIO (processo filho)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "grafana-stdio": {
      "command": "/caminho/para/dist/grafana-mcp",
      "transport": {
        "type": "stdio"
      },
      "env": {
        "GRAFANA_URL": "https://grafana.example.com",
        "GRAFANA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "glsa_example_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Esse modo executa o servidor como subprocesso direto do Claude, ideal para ambientes offline ou quando não se deseja abrir portas locais.
Antes de configurar o comando no Claude, execute `make package` para gerar o binário `dist/grafana-mcp` utilizado no exemplo acima.

## Próximos passos
O diretório `app/` pode receber novos módulos ou ferramentas MCP específicas da sua instância. Recomenda-se adicionar testes automatizados sob `tests/` à medida que novos recursos forem implementados.
