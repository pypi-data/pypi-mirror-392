Show Your Work
==============

We'd love to see what you've built with SymTorch!

Why Use SymTorch?
-----------------

SymTorch bridges the gap between the power of deep learning and the interpretability of symbolic mathematics. By combining neural networks with symbolic regression, you can:

- **Discover interpretable equations** from your trained models
- **Understand what your neural networks have learned** at both layer and model levels
- **Extract symbolic knowledge** from black-box models
- **Create explainable AI systems** that are both accurate and interpretable
- **Accelerate scientific discovery** by uncovering mathematical relationships in your data

Whether you're working on physics-informed neural networks, graph neural networks, or classical machine learning problems, SymTorch provides the tools to transform learned representations into human-readable mathematical expressions.
