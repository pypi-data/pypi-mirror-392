Always display the full label in the *product_label_section_and_note*
widget.

When using this widget (usually on purchase order lines and invoice
lines) the name or description of the line is treated by this widget to
display only certain information from the name, in what is called the
label of the widget.

More specifically, it removes the product name from the label (if
present), making it confusing in case you want to remove the actual
product name from the line description.

With this module, yoy always see the full content of the line name or
description in the label section of the widget. Although it can contain
doubled information (for example, if the description of the line is
exactly the same as the product name), it makes the edition of the line
description more clear and user-friendly.
