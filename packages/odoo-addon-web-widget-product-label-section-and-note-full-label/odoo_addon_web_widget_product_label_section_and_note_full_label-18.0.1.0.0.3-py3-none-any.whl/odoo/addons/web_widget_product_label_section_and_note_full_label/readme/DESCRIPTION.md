Always display the full label in the *product_label_section_and_note* widget.

When using this widget (usually on purchase order lines and invoice lines) the
name or description of the line is treated by this widget to display only
certain information from the name, in what is called the label of the widget.

More specifically, it removes the product name from the label (if present),
making it confusing in case you want to remove the actual product name from
the line description.

With this module, yoy always see the full content of the line name or
description in the label section of the widget. Although it can contain doubled
information (for example, if the description of the line is exactly the same as
the product name), it makes the edition of the line description more clear and
user-friendly.
