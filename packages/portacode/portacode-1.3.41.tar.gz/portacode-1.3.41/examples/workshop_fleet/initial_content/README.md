# Starter Project

This folder is baked into the workshop Docker image and copied to every student's `/root/workspace` the first time their container starts.

Contents:
- `app.py`: a trivial CLI entrypoint students can extend.
- `notes.md`: space for the instructor to pre-write hints.

Feel free to replace these files with anything relevant to your workshop exercises.
