## 📄 Draft Overview

I've generated the first draft of the "Why CANNs?" documentation based on your answers. The document includes:

### Structure (8 sections, ~2400 words)

1. **The Challenge** - Opens with brain navigation question, introduces continuous representations
2. **What Makes CANNs Special** - Theory, biological realism, A-CANN breakthrough
3. **Who Should Use This Library** - Neuroscientists, engineers, students
4. **Key Application Scenarios** - Theta sweep, education, performance (with benchmarks table)
5. **Why This Library** - Fragmented landscape → unified ecosystem vision
6. **Technical Foundations** - BrainState + Rust, comprehensive toolchain
7. **Getting Started** - 10-minute code example
8. **Next Steps** - Installation, links, summary table

### Visual Elements Included
- Smooth tracking 1D GIF
- Theta sweep animation GIF
- 2D encoding GIF
- Performance benchmark table
- Summary comparison table
- Code example

### Writing Style
- Motivational and accessible (avoiding heavy math)
- Problem → Solution → Benefit pattern
- Addresses three audiences (scientists, engineers, students)
- Honest about current status (beta, 4 months old)
- Clear call-to-action at the end

**Tips for Reviewing**:
- Don't worry about perfect prose yet—we can polish later
- Focus on big-picture issues first (structure, messaging, completeness)
- Be honest about what works and what doesn't
- It's okay to say "this whole section should be different"
- Think about your target readers—will they understand and care?
