    "Building a CANN model in this library is straightforward thanks to the integration with **BrainState**, a framework for dynamical systems built on JAX. This guide shows you how to:\n",

    "1. Set up the BrainState environment\n",
    "2. Create a CANN1D model instance\n",
    "3. Initialize the model state\n",
    "4. Run a simple forward pass\n",

    "## The Basics: BrainState Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "CANNs models are built using [BrainState](https://brainstate.readthedocs.io), which provides:\n",
    "- **Unified time-step management** via `brainstate.environ`\n",
    "- **State containers** (`State`, `HiddenState`, `ParamState`) for managing neural dynamics\n",
    "- **JIT compilation** through `brainstate.transform.for_loop` for high performance\n",
    "- **Automatic differentiation** support for gradient-based analysis\n",
