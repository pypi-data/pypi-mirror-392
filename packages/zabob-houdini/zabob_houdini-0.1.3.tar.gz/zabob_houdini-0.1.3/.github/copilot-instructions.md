# Copilot Instructions for Zabob-Houdini

## Project Overview
Zabob-Houdini is a Python API for creating Houdini node graphs programmatically. This is an early-stage project that provides a simplified interface for building and connecting Houdini nodes.

## Core Architecture Concepts

### Node Graph API Design
- **`node()`** function: Core API for creating individual nodes
  - Takes `NodeType`, optional name, and keyword attributes
  - Returns `NodeInstance` objects
  - Special `_input` keyword connects 0+ input nodes
- **`chain()`** function: Creates linear node sequences
  - Connects nodes in sequence automatically
  - Accepts `_input` for external connections
  - Can be nested/spliced into other chains
  - Returns `Chain` objects
- **Instantiation Pattern**: Both `NodeInstance` and `Chain` use `.create()` method for actual creation

### Project Structure
- `src/zabob_houdini/`: Main package directory
- Currently minimal implementation - most API described in README is not yet implemented
- Uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` and hatchling

## Development Conventions

### Response Guidelines
- **Be concise and focused** in all responses to prevent context overflow
- When performing code changes:
  - Make minimal, targeted edits that address the specific request
  - Avoid explaining what you're doing unless asked
  - Don't repeat information already established in the conversation
  - Skip verbose descriptions of obvious changes
- **Inline chat spatial signals**: When user starts with "here," "this line," "on this line," etc., make surgical changes at that exact location only
- **Context preservation**: Prioritize actionable content over explanatory text to maintain focus on technical work

### Python Standards
- **Compatibility**: Requires Python 3.11+ (pyproject.toml), for hython compatibility.
- Entry point: `zabob_houdini:main` console script
- **CLI framework**: Uses Click instead of argparse for command-line interface
- **Type hints**: Use modern built-in types (`list`, `dict`, `tuple`) instead of `typing.List`, etc.
- **Docstrings**: Write comprehensive docstrings for all public functions and classes, global variables.
  - Docstrings for global variables should follow the definition of the variable and provide a clear description of its purpose and usage.
- **Modern constructs**: Use dataclasses, match statements, and other Python 3.13+ features
- **Parameter typing**: Declare all parameter types explicitly

### Key Files to Understand
- `README.md`: Contains the complete API specification and usage patterns
- `src/zabob_houdini/__init__.py`: Current minimal implementation
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Python and Houdini-specific ignore patterns
- `.gitattributes`: LFS configuration for Houdini binary files
- `.env.example.*`: Platform-specific environment variable templates (users copy to `.env`)
- `stubs/hou.pyi`: Type stubs for Houdini's `hou` module for development IntelliSense
- `TODO.md`: Deferred tasks to avoid branching work - add items here instead of implementing immediately

## Implementation Notes

### Current State
The project is in early development - the README describes the intended API, but implementation is minimal (just a hello world function). When implementing:

1. **Follow the README specification exactly** - it defines the expected behavior
2. **Implement the `node()` and `chain()` functions** as the core API
3. **Create `NodeInstance` and `Chain` classes** with `.create()` methods
4. **Handle the `_input` keyword parameter** for node connections
5. **Start with string-based NodeType** (SOP node names like "box", "merge")
6. **Defer `hou` module calls** - only execute during `.create()`, not during node definition
7. **Plan for NodeTypeInstance expansion** - namespace resolution for duplicate names across categories

### Integration Considerations
- **Abstraction Layer**: This is a Python wrapper that calls Houdini's `hou` module during `.create()` execution
- **Houdini Python compatibility**: Watch for potential issues with `hython` and other Houdini Python tools due to historical version constraints
- **NodeType Implementation**:
  - Initially: strings representing SOP node type names (e.g., "box", "merge", "transform")
  - Future: `NodeTypeInstance` objects to resolve namespace conflicts across categories
  - Long-term: Context-aware validation (e.g., SOPs under `geo` nodes)
- **Creation Pattern**: Nodes are defined declaratively, then `.create()` calls `hou` module functions

## Testing & Development
- **Testing**: Uses pytest framework for testing
- **Package management**: Uses UV - always run `uv sync` after modifying dependencies in pyproject.toml
- **Code organization**: Consider dataclasses for structured data (e.g., node configurations)
- **Modern Python**: Leverage Python 3.13+ features like improved type hints and pattern matching
- No CI/CD setup yet - runs as console application via entry point
- Development should focus on implementing the API described in README.md first

### Test Architecture
- **Unit Tests**: Test object construction, equality, hashing, copying WITHOUT importing hou
  - **NEVER mock modules** - restructure tests to avoid import issues instead
  - Focus on dataclass behavior, caching via @functools.cache, immutability
  - Test the API functions (node(), chain()) rather than classes directly if needed
- **Integration Tests**: Use `hython_test` fixture to run actual Houdini operations
  - Never mock hou in integration tests - they should run in real Houdini environment
  - Call functions in `houdini_test_functions.py` via the bridge

### Module Import Strategy
- core.py imports hou at module level - this is correct for Houdini environment
- Unit tests should avoid importing core directly if it causes hou import issues
- Integration tests run in Houdini via hython_test fixture

### Context Overflow Prevention
- **Be extremely concise** - this project has hit context limits multiple times
- When architectural changes are needed, focus on ONE specific issue at a time
- Don't explain what you're doing unless asked - just make the minimal change
- If you find yourself in an edit loop, stop and ask for clarification
- The core.py architecture is mature - be very cautious about major changes

### Immutable Architecture (ESTABLISHED - Don't Change)
- Frozen dataclasses with @functools.cache for automatic caching
- HashableMapping for dict fields to enable hashing
- Objects constructed without hou imports, hou only imported in .create() methods
- Identity-based hashing allows object-specific caching
- .copy() methods create deep copies, .create() returns cached hou.Node instances

## Task Management
- **TODO.md**: Use for deferred tasks to avoid branching current work
- When encountering complex tasks that would derail current focus, add to TODO.md instead of implementing
- Keep TODO.md organized with categories and clear descriptions
- Mark completed items and remove them periodically

## VS Code Configuration Management
- **Personal Settings**: `.vscode/settings.json` is personal (not committed) and created from `.vscode/settings.json.example`
- **Template Sync**: When `.vscode/settings.json` is modified with project-relevant changes, remind the user to update `.vscode/settings.json.example` for other contributors
- **Project Files**: `.vscode/project-dictionary.txt`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, and `.vscode/setup-vscode.sh` are committed
- **Setup Script**: New contributors use `./.vscode/setup-vscode.sh` for automated setup
- **Spell Checking**: Uses cSpell with project dictionary - add technical terms to `.vscode/project-dictionary.txt`

## Communication Guidelines

### Avoid Sycophantic Language
- **NEVER** use phrases like "You're absolutely right!", "You're absolutely correct!", "Excellent point!", or similar flattery
- **NEVER** validate statements as "right" when the user didn't make a factual claim that could be evaluated
- **NEVER** use general praise or validation as conversational filler

### Appropriate Acknowledgments
Use brief, factual acknowledgments only to confirm understanding of instructions:
- "Got it."
- "Ok, that makes sense."
- "I understand."
- "I see the issue."

These should only be used when:
1. You genuinely understand the instruction and its reasoning
2. The acknowledgment adds clarity about what you'll do next
3. You're confirming understanding of a technical requirement or constraint

### Examples

#### ❌ Inappropriate (Sycophantic)
User: "Yes please."
Assistant: "You're absolutely right! That's a great decision."

User: "Let's remove this unused code."
Assistant: "Excellent point! You're absolutely correct that we should clean this up."

#### ✅ Appropriate (Brief Acknowledgment)
User: "Yes please."
Assistant: "Got it." [proceeds with the requested action]

User: "Let's remove this unused code."
Assistant: "I'll remove the unused code path." [proceeds with removal]

#### ✅ Also Appropriate (No Acknowledgment)
User: "Yes please."
Assistant: [proceeds directly with the requested action]

### Rationale
- Maintains professional, technical communication
- Avoids artificial validation of non-factual statements
- Focuses on understanding and execution rather than praise
- Prevents misrepresenting user statements as claims that could be "right" or "wrong"
