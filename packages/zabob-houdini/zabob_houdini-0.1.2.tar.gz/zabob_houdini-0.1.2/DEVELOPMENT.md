# Development Guide

This document contains detailed information for developers working on Zabob-Houdini.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package management. Install UV first:

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Alternative installation methods:** See the [UV installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Development Workflow

**Recommended two-phase approach:**

#### Phase 1: Development with Modern Python

```bash
# Use modern Python tooling for development
uv sync                           # Install with latest Python
uv run pytest tests/             # Run tests
uv run zabob-houdini validate     # Test CLI
```

#### Phase 2: Integration with Houdini

```python
# Copy your zabob-houdini code into Houdini contexts:
# - Python shelf tools
# - HDA Python scripts
# - Houdini's Python shell

from zabob_houdini import node, chain
# This works within Houdini's Python environment
```

### Python Version Compatibility

**Important:** This project supports Python 3.11+ for general use, but Houdini constrains you to its bundled Python:

- **Houdini 20.5-21.x**: Python 3.11 (current limitation)
- **Houdini 22.x+**: Expected to support newer Python versions (anticipated early 2025)
- **Development**: Use any Python 3.11+ for testing and development

**For Houdini-compatible development**, you can use the provided Python version pin:
```bash
cp .python-version-houdini .python-version  # Pin to Python 3.11 for Houdini compatibility
uv sync  # Will use Python 3.11
```

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd zabob-houdini
   ```

2. **Create the virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   This will:

   - Create a virtual environment with Python 3.13+
   - Install all project dependencies
   - Install the project in development mode

3. **Activate the virtual environment** (optional, UV handles this automatically):

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

## Testing

The project uses a two-tier testing approach to support both local development and CI:

**Quick Test Commands:**

```bash
./test.sh unit          # Unit tests (no Houdini required)
./test.sh integration   # Integration tests (requires Houdini)
./test.sh all          # All tests
./test.sh list         # List all available tests
```

**Manual Testing:**

```bash
# Unit tests only (runs in CI)
uv run pytest -m "unit and not integration" -v

# Integration tests (requires Houdini)
uv run pytest -m "integration" -v

# All tests
uv run pytest -v
```

**Test Categories:**

- **Unit Tests** (`@pytest.mark.unit`): Bridge functionality, utilities, basic imports
  - Run without Houdini installation
  - Fast execution (< 1 second)
  - Used in CI/CD pipelines

- **Integration Tests** (`@pytest.mark.integration`): Core API functionality
  - Require Houdini installation and `hython` binary
  - Test actual node creation and graph building
  - Run locally or in specialized CI environments

### Debugging

Because most of the tests do their work in a `hython` subprocess, it is challenging to debug what happens during a test.

If you have a directory named `hip/` in your working directory, the tests will write out hip files when they finish. This allows you to inspect the Houdini environment with the Houdini editor, or explore the final state interactively with the Houdini python shell. The directory to use can be overridden with the `TEST_HIP_DIR` environment variable, or suppressed by setting it to the empty string or a directory which does not exist. The `hip` directory does not exist in CI so it is not written in that context.

To debug in the debugger, first examine the test to find what function it runs in `hython` in [`houdini_test_functions.py`](src/zabob_houdini/houdini_test_functions.py).

Then use a launch configuration like this:
```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

        {
            "name": "Python Debugger: Module",
            "type": "debugpy",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "zabob_houdini",
            "args": [
                "_exec", "houdini_test_functions", "test_chain_reference_vs_copy"
            ],
            "justMyCode": false,
            "python": "/Applications/Houdini/Current/Frameworks/Houdini.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/bin/hython"

        }
    ]
}
```

**CI/CD:**

- **Pull Requests**: Run unit tests on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **Releases**: Run unit tests + linting + spell checking
- **Integration tests**: Run manually or on `main` branch with special label

## CLI Architecture Pattern

The zabob-houdini CLI uses a bridge pattern to execute commands in both regular Python and Houdini's `hython` environment. For complete CLI usage documentation, see **[Command Line Interface](COMMAND.md)**.

### Bridge Pattern Implementation

**1. CLI Entry Point (cli.py):**
- Uses Click for command structure
- Commands decorated with `@houdini_command` automatically dispatch to `hython`
- Regular Python commands work normally; Houdini-specific commands are bridged

**2. Houdini Implementation (houdini_info.py):**
- Contains the actual command logic that runs in Houdini
- Uses Click groups and commands that execute within `hython`
- Processes Houdini objects and data structures

**3. Bridge Mechanism:**
- `@houdini_command` decorator intercepts CLI calls
- Launches `hython -m zabob_houdini _exec <module> <function> <args>`
- Returns structured JSON results back to the CLI

### Example: Adding a New Python Info Command

These directions apply for commands which must run in a Houdini environment.  They will launch hython to perform the command if run in ordinary python.

#### Step 1: Add command to houdini_info.py

`houdini_info.py` holds code which runs in the Houdini environment.

```python
@info.command('types')
@click.argument('category', type=str, required=True)
def types(category: str):
    """List node types in the specified category."""
    for item in analyze_categories():
        if isinstance(item, NodeTypeInfo) and item.category.lower() == category.lower():
            click.echo(f"  {item.name}: {item.description}")
```

#### Step 2: Add bridge command to cli.py

This file gets a stub that runs hython with the same arguments. The mechanics for this are added by the `@houdini_command` decorator. The this should take the same arguments and options as the real command in `houdini_info.py`.

```python
@info.command('types')
@houdini_command
@click.argument('category', type=str, required=True)
def types(category: str) -> None:
    """List node types in the specified category."""
    pass  # Implementation handled by bridge
```

### Benefits

- **Dual Environment**: Same CLI works in both Python and Houdini contexts
- **Type Safety**: Full typing support for development in regular Python
- **Clean Separation**: Business logic separated from CLI bridging logic
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new commands following the same pattern

## Release Management

**Quick Release Commands:**

```bash
./release.sh status      # Check current version and git status
./release.sh test        # Test release workflow (TestPyPI)
./release.sh bump patch  # Bump version (patch/minor/major)
./release.sh release     # Create production release
```

**Release Workflow:**

1. **Test Release to TestPyPI:**
   ```bash
   ./release.sh test                    # Test current version
   # OR
   ./release.sh bump patch && ./release.sh test  # Bump and test
   ```
   - Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/BobKerns/zabob-houdini/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
   - Click "Run workflow" → Select "testpypi"
   - Test install: `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ zabob-houdini`

2. **Production Release to PyPI:**
   ```bash
   ./release.sh bump patch              # Update version
   git add pyproject.toml && git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
   ./release.sh release                 # Create tag and push (auto-publishes)
   ```
   - Creates git tag → triggers automated PyPI release
   - Generates GitHub Release with artifacts

**Manual Release (GitHub UI):**
- Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/BobKerns/zabob-houdini/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
- Click "Run workflow"
- Select repository: `testpypi` or `pypi`

## Houdini Integration

### For VS Code IntelliSense

For VS Code IntelliSense to work with Houdini's `hou` module, copy the appropriate platform-specific example file to `.env`:

**macOS:**

```bash
cp .env.example.macos .env
```

**Linux:**

```bash
cp .env.example.linux .env
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example.windows .env
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
copy .env.example.windows .env
```

Each example file contains common installation paths for that platform. Edit `.env` if your Houdini installation is in a different location.

### Using with Houdini

**Important:** Due to Houdini's architecture, `hython` has severe compatibility issues with virtual environments, UV, and modern Python tooling. The linked symbol requirements make it extremely difficult to use external Python packages reliably.

**Recommended approach for Houdini integration:**

1. **Development and Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Use regular Python for development
   uv run zabob-houdini info
   uv run python -c "from zabob_houdini import node; print('API works!')"
   ```

2. **Production Use within Houdini:**
   ```python
   # Install in Houdini's Python environment
   # Within Houdini's Python shell or scripts:
   import sys
   sys.path.append('/path/to/your/project/src')
   from zabob_houdini import node, chain

   # Create nodes within Houdini
   geo_node = node("/obj", "geo", name="mygeometry")
   result = geo_node.create()  # This works within Houdini
   ```

3. **Alternative Installation:**
   ```bash
   # Install package directly in Houdini's Python
   /path/to/houdini/hython -m pip install zabob-houdini
   ```

**Where to use zabob-houdini in Houdini:**
- **Python shelf tools**: Create custom shelf buttons with zabob-houdini code
- **HDA script sections**: Use in digital asset Python callbacks
- **Houdini Python shell**: Interactive development within Houdini
- **Python SOP/TOP nodes**: For procedural workflows

**Why hython is problematic:**
- Requires linked symbols that conflict with virtual environments
- Cannot reliably import packages from external Python environments
- UV and pip installations don't work correctly with hython
- Setting up `.pth` files and environment variables is fragile and unreliable

## VS Code Configuration

The project includes VS Code configuration for optimal development experience:

**Quick Setup (Recommended):**

```bash
# Automated setup script
./.vscode/setup-vscode.sh
```

**Manual Setup:**

```bash
# Copy the example settings to create your personal settings
cp .vscode/settings.json.example .vscode/settings.json
```

**What's included in the example settings:**

- **cSpell Integration**: Project dictionary for spell checking
- **Python Environment**: Automatic virtual environment detection
- **Houdini Integration**: Path to Houdini Python libraries for IntelliSense
- **Type Stubs**: Enhanced Houdini type hints from `stubs/` directory

**Personal Overrides:**

Your personal `.vscode/settings.json` won't be committed, so you can safely add:

```jsonc
{
    // Project settings (from example) - keep these for best experience
    "cSpell.customDictionaries": { /* ... */ },
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",

    // Add your personal preferences
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.theme": "your-favorite-theme",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
}
```

**Alternative: Workspace-only settings:**

If you prefer not to modify your personal settings, you can create a workspace-specific configuration by pressing `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and selecting `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)`.

**Why this approach?**

- **No forced settings**: Your personal VS Code preferences won't be overridden
- **Easy onboarding**: New contributors can get started quickly with the setup script
- **Shared essentials**: Project-specific configurations (dictionaries, paths) are shared
- **Personal freedom**: Add your own preferences without affecting others

## Code Spell Checking (cSpell)

The project includes spell checking configuration for VS Code and command-line tools:

- **Dictionary**: `.vscode/project-dictionary.txt` contains project-specific words
- **Configuration**: `cspell.json` provides comprehensive spell checking settings
- **VS Code Integration**: Words are automatically validated as you type

**Adding new words to the dictionary:**

1. In VS Code, right-click on a misspelled word and select "Add to project dictionary"
2. Or manually add words to `.vscode/project-dictionary.txt` (one word per line)
3. Or use the command line:

   ```bash
   echo "yourword" >> .vscode/project-dictionary.txt
   ```

**Running spell check manually:**

```bash
# Using npm scripts (recommended)
npm install                      # Install cSpell first
npm run spell-check              # Check all files (quiet)
npm run spell-check-files        # Check with file context
npm run spell-check-verbose      # Check with verbose output

# Or using npx directly
npx cspell "**/*.{py,md,txt,json}"  # Check all files
npx cspell README.md                # Check specific file
```

**Note**: The spell checker is configured to ignore common paths like `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, and build directories.

## Markdown Linting

The project uses markdownlint for consistent markdown formatting:

- **Configuration**: `.markdownlint.json` and VS Code settings suppress overly strict rules (MD021, MD022)
- **VS Code Integration**: Automatic linting as you edit markdown files
- **Rules disabled**: MD013 (line length), MD021/MD022 (heading spacing), MD031/MD032 (block spacing) for better readability

## Publishing to PyPI

This package is automatically published to PyPI using GitHub Actions. For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/PYPI_SETUP.md](docs/PYPI_SETUP.md).

**For releases:**
1. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.1
   git push origin v0.1.1
   ```
2. The workflow automatically:
   - Runs tests and checks
   - Builds the package
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates a GitHub release

**For testing:**
1. Use the manual workflow dispatch in GitHub Actions
2. Select "testpypi" to publish to Test PyPI first
3. Verify the package works correctly
