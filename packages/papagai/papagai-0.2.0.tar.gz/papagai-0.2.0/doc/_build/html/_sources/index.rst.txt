papagai Documentation
=====================

``papagai`` is a command-line tool that runs Claude AI on git repositories using isolated worktrees. It allows Claude to make changes in separate git worktrees, enabling multiple tasks to run simultaneously without interfering with the main working directory.

Key Features
------------

* **Isolated Worktrees**: All changes happen in dedicated git worktrees, keeping your main workspace clean
* **Concurrent Tasks**: Run multiple Claude tasks simultaneously without conflicts
* **Automatic Git Integration**: Changes are automatically committed and pulled back as branches
* **Pre-written Tasks**: Comes with built-in tasks and supports custom task templates
* **Flexible Isolation**: Supports both standard git worktrees and overlay filesystem worktrees

Quick Start

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install https://github.com/whot/papagai

If running from the git repository, use `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ uv run papagai

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary commands are ``code`` and ``do`` to get Claude to perform tasks:

.. code-block:: console

   $ papagai code

   [...]
   My work here is done. Check out branch papagai/main-2025-11-12-7be3946e

The ``code`` command includes programming best practices guidance, while ``do`` runs without the programming primer.
