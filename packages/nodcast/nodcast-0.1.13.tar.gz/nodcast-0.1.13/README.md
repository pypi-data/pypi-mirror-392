## What is NodCast

NodCast is a focused, segment-by-segment reading environment that lets you engage with text through written “nods” and inline questions. A nod is a small acknowledgement—*I see*, *hmm*, *wait, what?*—typed as you read. These signals help you track understanding, surface confusion, and reflect more deliberately on the material. Questions mark unclear moments and capture curiosity as it arises.

This feedback becomes part of the article itself, giving readers a more attentive experience and giving writers a clearer sense of how their work is received. NodCast runs entirely in the terminal with smooth keyboard navigation and a clean, distraction-free flow.
