        reflective:
        - '@nods?!'
      questions:
      - '@What exactly are nods?'

      questions:
      - '@Can I add custom nods?'

      questions:
      - '@How NodCast uses thes feedbacks?'
    - id: ''
      text: NodCast learns which parts engage you and which parts confuse you by observing
        your nods and questions. These signals are shared with article creators. Articles
        are also scored, and you can browse top-rated ones. Future versions may adapt
        pacing, difficulty, or provide targeted explanations based on your nod history.
      nods:
        affirmative:
        - '@I see!'

        reflective:
        - didn't get
