Tool for getting results from fakexy.com

# Usage

outputs json in each line.

fakexy has aggressive cloudflare protection so browser might be necessary to solve captchas. You can then use `--browser` option to get cookies from browser or pass them directly with `--header`. You can also use `--wait` to wait in between requests, although cloudflare seems to trigger only after time of inactivity.

```bash
fakexy 'https://www.fakexy.com/uk-fake-address-generator-south-humberside' 10 --browser firefox --wait 0.8

## Library

### Code

```python
from fakexy import fakexy
import requests

fxy = fakexy(wait=1.2,browser="firefox")

try:
    for i in fxy.guess(r'https://www.fakexy.com/fake-address-generator-de', count=80):
        print(i)
except requests.RequestException:
    pass
```

### Methods

`animals`, `addresses`, `names`, `creditcards`, `phones` and `zipcodes` methods take `url` to resource and optionally `count` of elements to return through generator. `count` can be arbitrarily large since it'll split into multiple api calls.

Resources fall into many categories and i didn't bother with creating a complete list of them, that's why all of these functions take `url`, if you need something just find it on the site.

All of the aforementioned methods can be replaced by calling `guess` which takes the same arguments, but also discerns which of them to call based on it, returning their ourput.
