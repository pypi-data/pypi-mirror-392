# VKPyKit

This ipackage contains several functions used for Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression, Decision Trees. Instead of writing those everytime, just wanted to put them in a package and reuse myself. 

Never liked to write same code over and over, PyPI allows to reuse your code. 

~~~
## Using my own Pythn libraries for Exploratory Data Analysis and Decision Tree Modeling.
## 1. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis
## 2. DT - Decision Tree
## Easier to write once and use as packaged functions. 

from VKPyKit.EDA import *
from VKPyKit.DT import *

EDA= EDA()
DT = DT()
~~~
Use it as is, if you find issues or have more such functions, please contribute on github.
