Critical Distance Graph
=================================

The last feauture of the library is the ability to generate critical distance graphs of the results of the experiments. The following code snippet demonstrates how to generate a critical distance diagram of the results of the experiments for a selected metric:

.. code-block:: python

    from SAES.plots.cdplot import CDplot

    # Load the data and metrics from the CSV files
    data = "swarmIntelligence.csv"
    metrics = "multiobjectiveMetrics.csv"

    # Save the critical distance plot on disk instead of displaying it
    cdplot = CDplot(data, metrics, "NHV")
    cdplot.save("./output/")

The above code snippet generates a critical distance diagram for the experimental results of all problems based on the selected metric "NHV." The critical distance diagram is saved as a PNG file in the current working directory because we are using the `save()` function, and it will look similar to this:

.. image:: NHV_cd_plot.png
   :alt: CD diagram
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
