# Axiomatic MCP Servers

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join%20Discord-5865f2?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/KKU97ZR5)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide AI assistants with access to the Axiomatic_AI Platform - a suite of advanced tools for scientific computing, document processing, and photonic circuit design.

## 🚀 Quickstart

#### 1. Check system requirements

- Python
  - Install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- uv
  - Install [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
  - Recommended not to install in conda (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))
- install extra packages (optional)
  - If you wish to use the AxPhotonicsPreview, you will need to install extra dependencies before continuing. After installing uv, run `uv tool install "axiomatic-mcp[pic]"`.

#### 2. Install your favourite client

[Cursor installation](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/installation)

#### 3. Get an API key

> You will receive an API key by email shortly after filling the form. Check your spam folder if it doesn't arrive.

#### 4. Install Axiomatic Operators (all except AxPhotonicsPreview)

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot install in Conda environment

It's not recommended to install axiomatic operators inside a conda environment. `uv` handles seperate python environments so it is safe to run "globally" without affecting your existing Python environments

### Server not appearing in Cursor

1. Restart Cursor after updating MCP settings
2. Check the Output panel (View → Output → MCP) for errors
3. Verify the command path is correct

### The "Add to cursor" button does not work

We have seen reports of the cursor window not opening correctly. If this happens you may manually add to cursor by:

1. Open cursor
2. Go to "Settings" > "Cursor Settings" > "MCP & Integration"
3. Click "New MCP Server"
4. Add the following configuration:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axiomatic-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx --from axiomatic-mcp all",
      "env": {
        "AXIOMATIC_API_KEY": "YOUR API KEY"
      },
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Multiple servers overwhelming the LLM

Install only the domain servers you need. Each server runs independently, so you can add/remove them as needed.

### API connection errors

1. Verify your API key is set correctly
2. Check internet connection

### Tools not appearing

If you experience any issues such as tools not appearing, it may be that you are using an old version and need to clear uv's cache to update it.

```bash
uv cache clean
```

Then restart your MCP client (e.g. restart Cursor).

This clears the uv cache and forces fresh downloads of packages on the next run.

## Individual servers

You may find more information about each server and how to install them individually in their own READMEs.
