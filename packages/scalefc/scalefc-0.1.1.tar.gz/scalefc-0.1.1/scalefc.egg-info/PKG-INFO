# Algorithm Introduction

**Paper Title**: `ScaleFC: A scale-aware geographical flow clustering algorithm for heterogeneous origin-destination data`



This study proposes a scale-aware geographical flow clustering method (ScaleFC) to address flow clustering problems caused by heterogeneous geographical flow characteristics such as uneven length, heterogeneous density, and weak connectivity. The method introduces a scale factor to adjust the neighborhood search range for flows of different lengths, balancing the identification of both short- and long-distance flow clusters. Meanwhile, inspired by boundary-seeking clustering, ScaleFC introduces partitioning flows (boundary flows between adjacent flow clusters) to identify density-heterogeneous flow clusters and separate weakly-connected flow clusters. As shown in the figure below, the method consists of `4` steps:

- `S1`: Identifying flow groups via spatial connectivity. Calculate flow neighborhood search range based on the scale factor and count the number of neighbors. Distinguish feature flows from noise flows according to $MinFlows$ threshold, and generate flow groups through connection operations.

- `S2`: Recognizing strongly-connected flow groups. Calculate the spatial compactness indicator of each flow group. If smaller than the neighborhood range of the centroid flow of the group, it is a strongly-connected group and directly retained as a flow cluster; otherwise, it is a weakly-connected group that needs further processing.
- `S3`: Handling weakly-connected flow groups. Identify partitioning flows with the most significant local density changes, use partitioning flows to split a flow group into two sub-groups, then recursively process each sub-group.
- `S4`: Reallocating partitioning flows and outputting cluster results. Pre-assign partitioning flows to the nearest flow cluster and verify whether compactness indicator constraints are satisfied. If constraints are satisfied, retain in that cluster; otherwise, treat as noise. Output final clustering results after processing is complete.

The figure below shows the detailed processing flow of the algorithm using example data.

# Features

This repository is the official implementation of the algorithm, which improves algorithm efficiency and reduces memory consumption compared to the [ZPGuiGroupWhu/ScaleFC](https://github.com/ZPGuiGroupWhu/ScaleFC) version implementation. Note that this algorithm uses approximate calculations in the partitioning flow assignment step for acceleration, so the clustering results may have slight differences from the original algorithm. Overall, the current version of the algorithm implementation has the following features:

- **High Efficiency**: This algorithm supports multi-process acceleration. Processing approximately `20,000` `OD` flows takes only about `25s`.
- **Low Memory**: Peak memory usage is independent of the number of `OD` flows, with peak memory consumption of approximately `2GB`, ensuring the algorithm can run on most computers.
- **Multiple usage**: Provides both command-line and `python` library usage methods.
- **Extensible**: Algorithm parameters provide flexible interfaces to adapt to different application scenarios.
- **Easy Integration**: The algorithm mainly depends on the scientific computing library `sklearn`, supporting integration with other algorithms.

The algorithm's runtime efficiency and memory consumption on synthetic datasets of different scales are shown in the figure below:

The advantage of this installation method is that it can stay consistent with the algorithm repository on `github`, making updates convenient.

The installation command is:
```shell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ZPGuiGroupWhu/scalefc-pkg.git

```shell
pip install scalefc-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

# Usage Tutorial

The `scalefc` package supports two usage methods: as a `python` library and as a command-line tool. The following provides detailed introductions to these two usage methods.

## Use as Python Library

The `scalefc` algorithm package provides the `flow_cluster_scalefc` function for clustering geographical flow data. The meaning of each parameter in the function is as follows:

```python
def flow_cluster_scalefc(
    OD: ODArray,  # OD flow matrix, numpy array with shape (N,4), each row contains [origin_x, origin_y, destination_x, destination_y] planar rectangular coordinate information
    scale_factor: float | None = 0.1,  # Scale factor, value range (0, 1], used to dynamically calculate the search neighborhood range (epsilon) for each flow
    min_flows: int = 5,  # Minimum number of flows, minimum number of flows required to form a valid cluster, groups with fewer than this value are considered noise
    scale_factor_func: Union[
        Literal["linear", "square", "sqrt", "tanh"],
        Callable[[np.ndarray, float], np.ndarray],
    ] = "linear",  # Controls the type of scale factor model, default is linear
    fixed_eps: float | None = None,  # Fixed neighborhood radius epsilon, if provided, it will override the automatic calculation method of scale_factor, all flows use a fixed neighborhood range
    n_jobs: int | None = None,  # Number of parallel processes, None for sequential execution, -1 for all CPUs, positive integer specifies number of cores
    debug: bool | Literal["simple", "full"] = False,  # Debug output, whether to print detailed debug information, including intermediate results and timing
    show_time_usage: bool = False,  # Whether to display time consumption for each step
    **kwargs,  # Other advanced custom parameters (see explanation below)
) -> Label:
    """Execute ScaleFC algorithm.

        This function implements the geographical flow clustering algorithm proposed in the paper ScaleFC: A scale-aware geographical flow clustering algorithm for heterogeneous origin-destination data.
        The algorithm mainly consists of the following steps:

            1. Identify flow groups based on spatial connection mechanism
            2. Determine whether flow groups are strongly connected or weakly connected flow groups, strongly connected flow groups are directly retained as flow clusters, weakly connected flow groups undergo subsequent processing
            3. Process weakly connected flow groups, find partitioning flows of flow groups based on local density, then split flow clusters into 2 sub-groups, and recursively process these 2 sub-groups
            4. Process all partitioning flows, attempt to assign them to the nearest flow cluster, and output clustering results


        ScaleFC algorithm has good clustering effects for flows with uneven lengths, density heterogeneity, and weak connections. See the original paper for algorithm details.

                - can_discard_flow_group_func (Callable, optional): Custom function to determine whether to discard a certain flow group, parameters are (OD_subset, **params), returns boolean value

                - Non-negative integers: Cluster numbers (0, 1, 2, ...)
                - -1: Noise flows (flows not belonging to any cluster) # Clustering label array

            AssertionError: If input validation fails (including: OD is not a 4-column 2D array, min_flows is not a positive integer, fixed_eps is not a positive number, n_jobs is less than -1, etc.)

```

After installing the `scalefc` library, the way to call this function is as follows:

```python
from scalefc import flow_cluster_scalefc
import numpy as np
OD = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(1000, 4))
label = flow_cluster_scalefc(OD, scale_factor=0.3, min_flows=5)
print(label)
```

## Use as Command Line Tool
In addition to using the python library method, `scalefc` also provides a command-line tool. The way to use the command-line tool is as follows:

```shell

The command line parameters have exactly the same meaning as the `flow_cluster_scalefc` function parameters. Note that use `-f` to specify the `OD` file path, which can be a local path or a network path. Moreover, the file format must satisfy one of the following two conditions to be executed:
- File header is `ox,oy,dx,dy`
- File header is `ox,oy,dx,dy,label` (where `label` represents the true labels of the data)

The `OD` flow data file format must be unified to the above format before it can be processed using command line calls.

An example call is as follows:
