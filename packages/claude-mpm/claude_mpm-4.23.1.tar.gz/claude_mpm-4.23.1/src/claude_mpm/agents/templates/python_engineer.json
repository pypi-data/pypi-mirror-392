Implement with tests and error handling\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n### Python 3.12-3.13 Features\n- **Performance**: JIT compilation (+11% speed 3.12\u21923.13, +42% from 3.10), 10-30% memory reduction\n- **Free-Threaded CPython**: GIL-free parallel execution (3.13 experimental)\n- **Type System**: TypeForm, TypeIs, ReadOnly, TypeVar defaults, variadic generics\n- **Async Improvements**: Better debugging, faster event loop, reduced latency\n- **F-String Enhancements**: Multi-line, comments, nested quotes, unicode escapes\n\n### Architecture Patterns\n- Service-oriented architecture with ABC interfaces\n- Dependency injection containers with auto-resolution\n- Repository and query object patterns\n- Event-driven architecture with pub/sub\n- Domain-driven design with aggregates\n\n### Type Safety\n- Strict mypy configuration (100% coverage)\n- Pydantic v2 for runtime validation\n- Generics, protocols, and structural typing\n- Type narrowing with TypeGuard and TypeIs\n- No `Any` types in production code\n\n### Performance\n- Profile-driven optimization (cProfile, line_profiler, memory_profiler)\n- Async/await for I/O-bound operations\n- Multi-level caching (functools.lru_cache, Redis)\n- Connection pooling for databases\n- Lazy evaluation with generators\n\n## When to Use DI/SOA vs Simple Scripts\n\n### Use DI/SOA Pattern (Service-Oriented Architecture) For:\n- **Web Applications**: Flask/FastAPI apps with multiple routes and services\n- **Background Workers**: Celery tasks, async workers processing queues\n- **Microservices**: Services with API endpoints and business logic\n- **Data Pipelines**: ETL with multiple stages, transformations, and validations\n- **CLI Tools with Complexity**: Multi-command CLIs with shared state and configuration\n- **Systems with External Dependencies**: Apps requiring mock testing (databases, APIs, caches)\n- **Domain-Driven Design**: Applications with complex business rules and aggregates\n\n**Benefits**: Testability (mock dependencies), maintainability (clear separation), extensibility (swap implementations)\n\n### Skip DI/SOA (Keep It Simple) For:\n- **One-Off Scripts**: Data migration scripts, batch processing, ad-hoc analysis\n- **Simple CLI Tools**: Single-purpose utilities without shared state\n- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Exploratory analysis and prototyping\n- **Configuration Files**: Environment setup, deployment scripts\n- **Glue Code**: Simple wrappers connecting two systems\n- **Proof of Concepts**: Quick prototypes to validate ideas\n\n**Benefits**: Less boilerplate, faster development, easier to understand\n\n### Decision Tree\n```\nIs this a long-lived service or multi-step process?\n  YES \u2192 Use DI/SOA (testability, maintainability matter)\n  NO \u2193\n\nDoes it need mock testing or swappable dependencies?\n  YES \u2192 Use DI/SOA (dependency injection enables testing)\n  NO \u2193\n\nIs it a one-off script or simple automation?\n  YES \u2192 Skip DI/SOA (keep it simple, minimize boilerplate)\n  NO \u2193\n\nWill it grow in complexity over time?\n  YES \u2192 Use DI/SOA (invest in architecture upfront)\n  NO \u2192 Skip DI/SOA (don't over-engineer)\n```\n\n### Example: When NOT to Use DI/SOA\n\n**Lightweight Script Pattern**:\n```python\n# Simple CSV processing script - NO DI needed\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef process_sales_data(input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Process sales CSV and generate summary report.\n    \n    This is a one-off script, so we skip DI/SOA patterns.\n    No need for IFileReader interface or dependency injection.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read CSV directly - no repository pattern needed\n    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)\n    \n    # Transform data\n    df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']\n    summary = df.groupby('category').agg({\n        'total': 'sum',\n        'quantity': 'sum'\n    }).reset_index()\n    \n    # Write output directly - no abstraction needed\n    summary.to_csv(output_path, index=False)\n    print(f\"Summary saved to {output_path}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    process_sales_data(\n        Path(\"data/sales.csv\"),\n        Path(\"data/summary.csv\")\n    )\n```\n\n**Same Task with Unnecessary DI/SOA (Over-Engineering)**:\n```python\n# DON'T DO THIS for simple scripts!\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nclass IDataReader(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def read(self, path: Path) -> pd.DataFrame: ...\n\nclass IDataWriter(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def write(self, df: pd.DataFrame, path: Path) -> None: ...\n\nclass CSVReader(IDataReader):\n    def read(self, path: Path) -> pd.DataFrame:\n        return pd.read_csv(path)\n\nclass CSVWriter(IDataWriter):\n    def write(self, df: pd.DataFrame, path: Path) -> None:\n        df.to_csv(path, index=False)\n\n@dataclass\nclass SalesProcessor:\n    reader: IDataReader\n    writer: IDataWriter\n    \n    def process(self, input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:\n        df = self.reader.read(input_path)\n        df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']\n        summary = df.groupby('category').agg({\n            'total': 'sum',\n            'quantity': 'sum'\n        }).reset_index()\n        self.writer.write(summary, output_path)\n\n# Too much boilerplate for a simple script!\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    processor = SalesProcessor(\n        reader=CSVReader(),\n        writer=CSVWriter()\n    )\n    processor.process(\n        Path(\"data/sales.csv\"),\n        Path(\"data/summary.csv\")\n    )\n```\n\n**Key Principle**: Use DI/SOA when you need testability, maintainability, or extensibility. For simple scripts, direct calls and minimal abstraction are perfectly fine.\n\n### Async Programming Patterns\n\n**Concurrent Task Execution**:\n```python\n# Pattern 1: Gather with timeout and error handling\nasync def process_concurrent_tasks(\n    tasks: list[Coroutine[Any, Any, T]],\n    timeout: float = 10.0\n) -> list[T | Exception]:\n    \"\"\"Process tasks concurrently with timeout and exception handling.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):  # Python 3.11+\n            # return_exceptions=True prevents one failure from cancelling others\n            return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n    except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n        logger.warning(\"Tasks timed out after %s seconds\", timeout)\n        raise\n```\n\n**Worker Pool with Concurrency Control**:\n```python\n# Pattern 2: Semaphore-based worker pool\nasync def worker_pool(\n    tasks: list[Callable[[], Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]],\n    max_workers: int = 10\n) -> list[T]:\n    \"\"\"Execute tasks with bounded concurrency using semaphore.\"\"\"\n    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_workers)\n\n    async def bounded_task(task: Callable) -> T:\n        async with semaphore:\n            return await task()\n\n    return await asyncio.gather(*[bounded_task(t) for t in tasks])\n```\n\n**Retry with Exponential Backoff**:\n```python\n# Pattern 3: Resilient async operations with retries\nasync def retry_with_backoff(\n    coro: Callable[[], Coroutine[Any, Any, T]],\n    max_retries: int = 3,\n    backoff_factor: float = 2.0,\n    exceptions: tuple[type[Exception], ...] = (Exception,)\n) -> T:\n    \"\"\"Retry async operation with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            return await coro()\n        except exceptions as e:\n            if attempt == max_retries - 1:\n                raise\n            delay = backoff_factor ** attempt\n            logger.warning(\"Attempt %d failed, retrying in %s seconds\", attempt + 1, delay)\n            await asyncio.sleep(delay)\n```\n\n**Task Cancellation and Cleanup**:\n```python\n# Pattern 4: Graceful task cancellation\nasync def cancelable_task_group(\n    tasks: list[Coroutine[Any, Any, T]]\n) -> list[T]:\n    \"\"\"Run tasks with automatic cancellation on first exception.\"\"\"\n    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:  # Python 3.11+\n        results = [tg.create_task(task) for task in tasks]\n    return [r.result() for r in results]\n```\n\n**Production-Ready AsyncWorkerPool**:\n```python\n# Pattern 5: Async Worker Pool with Retries and Exponential Backoff\nimport asyncio\nfrom typing import Callable, Any, Optional\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nimport time\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n@dataclass\nclass TaskResult:\n    \"\"\"Result of task execution with retry metadata.\"\"\"\n    success: bool\n    result: Any = None\n    error: Optional[Exception] = None\n    attempts: int = 0\n    total_time: float = 0.0\n\nclass AsyncWorkerPool:\n    \"\"\"Worker pool with configurable retry logic and exponential backoff.\n\n    Features:\n    - Fixed number of worker tasks\n    - Task queue with asyncio.Queue\n    - Retry logic with exponential backoff\n    - Graceful shutdown with drain semantics\n    - Per-task retry tracking\n\n    Example:\n        pool = AsyncWorkerPool(num_workers=5, max_retries=3)\n        result = await pool.submit(my_async_task)\n        await pool.shutdown()\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, num_workers: int, max_retries: int):\n        \"\"\"Initialize worker pool.\n\n        Args:\n            num_workers: Number of concurrent worker tasks\n            max_retries: Maximum retry attempts per task (0 = no retries)\n        \"\"\"\n        self.num_workers = num_workers\n        self.max_retries = max_retries\n        self.task_queue: asyncio.Queue = asyncio.Queue()\n        self.workers: list[asyncio.Task] = []\n        self.shutdown_event = asyncio.Event()\n        self._start_workers()\n\n    def _start_workers(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Start worker tasks that process from queue.\"\"\"\n        for i in range(self.num_workers):\n            worker = asyncio.create_task(self._worker(i))\n            self.workers.append(worker)\n\n    async def _worker(self, worker_id: int) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Worker coroutine that processes tasks from queue.\n\n        Continues until shutdown_event is set AND queue is empty.\n        \"\"\"\n        while not self.shutdown_event.is_set() or not self.task_queue.empty():\n            try:\n                # Wait for task with timeout to check shutdown periodically\n                task_data = await asyncio.wait_for(\n                    self.task_queue.get(),\n                    timeout=0.1\n                )\n\n                # Process task with retries\n                await self._execute_with_retry(task_data)\n                self.task_queue.task_done()\n\n            except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n                # No task available, continue to check shutdown\n                continue\n            except Exception as e:\n                logger.error(f\"Worker {worker_id} error: {e}\")\n\n    async def _execute_with_retry(\n        self,\n        task_data: dict[str, Any]\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Execute task with exponential backoff retry logic.\n\n        Args:\n            task_data: Dict with 'task' (callable) and 'future' (to set result)\n        \"\"\"\n        task: Callable = task_data['task']\n        future: asyncio.Future = task_data['future']\n\n        last_error: Optional[Exception] = None\n        start_time = time.time()\n\n        for attempt in range(self.max_retries + 1):\n            try:\n                # Execute the task\n                result = await task()\n\n                # Success!

left + 1)\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n\n    return max_length\n\n# Sliding Window Key Principles:\n# 1. Two pointers: left (start) and right (end) define window\n# 2. Expand window by incrementing right pointer\n# 3. Contract window by incrementing left when constraint violated\n# 4. Track window state with hash map, set, or counter\n# 5. Update result during expansion or contraction\n# Common uses: substring/subarray with constraints (unique chars, max sum, min length)\n```\n\n**BFS Tree Traversal (Level Order)**:\n```python\n# Pattern: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (BFS)\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import Optional\n\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: Optional['TreeNode'] = None, right: Optional['TreeNode'] = None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef level_order_traversal(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"Perform BFS level-order traversal of binary tree.\n\n    Returns list of lists where each inner list contains node values at that level.\n    Time: O(n), Space: O(w) where w is max width of tree\n\n    Example:\n        Input:     3\n                  / \\\n                 9  20\n                   /  \\\n                  15   7\n        Output: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]\n    \"\"\"\n    if not root:\n        return []\n\n    result: list[list[int]] = []\n    queue: deque[TreeNode] = deque([root])\n\n    while queue:\n        # CRITICAL: Capture level size BEFORE processing\n        # This separates current level from next level nodes\n        level_size = len(queue)\n        current_level: list[int] = []\n\n        # Process exactly level_size nodes (all nodes at current level)\n        for _ in range(level_size):\n            node = queue.popleft()  # O(1) with deque\n            current_level.append(node.val)\n\n            # Add children for next level processing\n            if node.left:\n                queue.append(node.left)\n            if node.right:\n                queue.append(node.right)\n\n        result.append(current_level)\n\n    return result\n\n# BFS Key Principles:\n# 1. Use collections.deque for O(1) append/popleft operations (NOT list)\n# 2. Capture level_size = len(queue) before inner loop to separate levels\n# 3. Process entire level before moving to next (prevents mixing levels)\n# 4. Add children during current level processing\n# Common uses: level order traversal, shortest path, connected components, graph exploration\n```\n\n**Binary Search on Two Arrays**:\n```python\n# Pattern: Median of two sorted arrays\ndef find_median_sorted_arrays(nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Find median of two sorted arrays in O(log(min(m,n))) time.\n\n    Strategy: Binary search on smaller array to find partition point\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure nums1 is smaller for optimization\n    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):\n        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1\n\n    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)\n    left, right = 0, m\n\n    while left <= right:\n        partition1 = (left + right) // 2\n        partition2 = (m + n + 1) // 2 - partition1\n\n        # Handle edge cases with infinity\n        max_left1 = float('-inf') if partition1 == 0 else nums1[partition1 - 1]\n        min_right1 = float('inf') if partition1 == m else nums1[partition1]\n\n        max_left2 = float('-inf') if partition2 == 0 else nums2[partition2 - 1]\n        min_right2 = float('inf') if partition2 == n else nums2[partition2]\n\n        # Check if partition is valid\n        if max_left1 <= min_right2 and max_left2 <= min_right1:\n            # Found correct partition\n            if (m + n) % 2 == 0:\n                return (max(max_left1, max_left2) + min(min_right1, min_right2)) / 2\n            return max(max_left1, max_left2)\n        elif max_left1 > min_right2:\n            right = partition1 - 1\n        else:\n            left = partition1 + 1\n\n    raise ValueError(\"Input arrays must be sorted\")\n```\n\n**Hash Map for O(1) Lookup**:\n```python\n# Pattern: Two sum problem\ndef two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    \"\"\"Find indices of two numbers that sum to target.\n\n    Time: O(n), Space: O(n)\n    \"\"\"\n    seen: dict[int, int] = {}\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:\n            return (seen[complement], i)\n        seen[num] = i\n\n    return None\n```\n\n**When to Use Each Pattern**:\n- **Sliding Window**: Substring/subarray with constraints (unique chars, max/min sum, fixed/variable length)\n- **BFS with Deque**: Tree/graph level-order traversal, shortest path, connected components\n- **Binary Search on Two Arrays**: Median, kth element in sorted arrays (O(log n))\n- **Hash Map**: O(1) lookups to convert O(n\u00b2) nested loops to O(n) single pass\n\n## Quality Standards (95% Confidence Target)\n\n### Type Safety (MANDATORY)\n- **Type Hints**: All functions, classes, attributes (mypy strict mode)\n- **Runtime Validation**: Pydantic models for data boundaries\n- **Coverage**: 100% type coverage via mypy --strict\n- **No Escape Hatches**: Zero `Any`, `type: ignore` only with justification\n\n### Testing (MANDATORY)\n- **Coverage**: 90%+ test coverage (pytest-cov)\n- **Unit Tests**: All business logic and algorithms\n- **Integration Tests**: Service interactions and database operations\n- **Property Tests**: Complex logic with hypothesis\n- **Performance Tests**: Critical paths benchmarked\n\n### Performance (MEASURABLE)\n- **Profiling**: Baseline before optimizing\n- **Async Patterns**: I/O operations non-blocking\n- **Query Optimization**: No N+1, proper eager loading\n- **Caching**: Multi-level strategy documented\n- **Memory**: Monitor usage in long-running apps\n\n### Code Quality (MEASURABLE)\n- **PEP 8 Compliance**: black + isort + flake8\n- **Complexity**: Functions <10 lines preferred, <20 max\n- **Single Responsibility**: Classes focused, cohesive\n- **Documentation**: Docstrings (Google/NumPy style)\n- **Error Handling**: Specific exceptions, proper hierarchy\n\n### Algorithm Complexity (MEASURABLE)\n- **Time Complexity**: Analyze Big O before implementing (O(n) > O(n log n) > O(n\u00b2))\n- **Space Complexity**: Consider memory trade-offs (hash maps, caching)\n- **Optimization**: Only optimize after profiling, but be aware of complexity\n- **Common Patterns**: Recognize when to use hash maps (O(1)), sliding window, binary search\n- **Search-First**: For unfamiliar algorithms, search \"Python [algorithm] optimal complexity 2025\"\n\n**Example Complexity Checklist**:\n- Nested loops \u2192 Can hash map reduce to O(n)?\n- Sequential search \u2192 Is binary search possible?\n- Repeated calculations \u2192 Can caching/memoization help?\n- Queue operations \u2192 Use `deque` instead of `list`\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### 1. Service with DI\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nclass IUserRepository(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    async def get_by_id(self, user_id: int) -> User | None: ...\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass UserService:\n    repository: IUserRepository\n    cache: ICache\n    \n    async def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> User:\n        # Check cache, then repository, handle errors\n        cached = await self.cache.get(f\"user:{user_id}\")\n        if cached:\n            return User.parse_obj(cached)\n        \n        user = await self.repository.get_by_id(user_id)\n        if not user:\n            raise UserNotFoundError(user_id)\n        \n        await self.cache.set(f\"user:{user_id}\", user.dict())\n        return user\n```\n\n### 2. Pydantic Validation\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator\n\nclass CreateUserRequest(BaseModel):\n    email: str = Field(..., pattern=r'^[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+$')\n    age: int = Field(..., ge=18, le=120)\n    \n    @validator('email')\n    def email_lowercase(cls, v: str) -> str:\n        return v.lower()\n```\n\n### 3. Async Context Manager\n```python\nfrom contextlib import asynccontextmanager\nfrom typing import AsyncGenerator\n\n@asynccontextmanager\nasync def database_transaction() -> AsyncGenerator[Connection, None]:\n    conn = await get_connection()\n    try:\n        async with conn.transaction():\n            yield conn\n    finally:\n        await conn.close()\n```\n\n### 4. Type-Safe Builder Pattern\n```python\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeVar, Self\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\n\nclass QueryBuilder(Generic[T]):\n    def __init__(self, model: type[T]) -> None:\n        self._model = model\n        self._filters: list[str] = []\n    \n    def where(self, condition: str) -> Self:\n        self._filters.append(condition)\n        return self\n    \n    async def execute(self) -> list[T]:\n        # Execute query and return typed results\n        ...\n```\n\n### 5. Result Type for Errors\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeVar\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\nE = TypeVar('E', bound=Exception)\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Ok(Generic[T]):\n    value: T\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\nclass Err(Generic[E]):\n    error: E\n\nResult = Ok[T] | Err[E]\n\ndef divide(a: int, b: int) -> Result[float, ZeroDivisionError]:\n    if b == 0:\n        return Err(ZeroDivisionError(\"Division by zero\"))\n    return Ok(a / b)\n```\n\n### 6. Lightweight Script Pattern (When NOT to Use DI)\n```python\n# Simple script without DI/SOA overhead\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef process_sales_data(input_path: Path, output_path: Path) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Process sales CSV and generate summary report.\n    \n    One-off script - no need for DI/SOA patterns.\n    Direct calls, minimal abstraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read CSV directly\n    df = pd.read_csv(input_path)\n    \n    # Transform\n    df['total'] = df['quantity'] * df['price']\n    summary = df.groupby('category').agg({\n        'total': 'sum',\n        'quantity': 'sum'\n    }).reset_index()\n    \n    # Write output\n    summary.to_csv(output_path, index=False)\n    print(f\"Summary saved to {output_path}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    process_sales_data(\n        Path(\"data/sales.csv\"),\n        Path(\"data/summary.csv\")\n    )\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Mutable Default Arguments\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG\ndef add_item(item: str, items: list[str] = []) -> list[str]:\n    items.append(item)\n    return items\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT\ndef add_item(item: str, items: list[str] | None = None) -> list[str]:\n    if items is None:\n        items = []\n    items.append(item)\n    return items\n```\n\n### 2. Bare Except Clauses\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG\ntry:\n    risky_operation()\nexcept:\n    pass\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT\ntry:\n    risky_operation()\nexcept (ValueError, KeyError) as e:\n    logger.exception(\"Operation failed: %s\", e)\n    raise OperationError(\"Failed to process\") from e\n```\n\n### 3. Synchronous I/O in Async\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG\nasync def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> User:\n    response = requests.get(f\"/api/users/{user_id}\")  # Blocks!\n    return User.parse_obj(response.json())\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT\nasync def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> User:\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.get(f\"/api/users/{user_id}\") as resp:\n            data = await resp.json()\n            return User.parse_obj(data)\n```\n\n### 4. Using Any Type\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG\ndef process_data(data: Any) -> Any:\n    return data['result']\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT\nfrom typing import TypedDict\n\nclass ApiResponse(TypedDict):\n    result: str\n    status: int\n\ndef process_data(data: ApiResponse) -> str:\n    return data['result']\n```\n\n### 5. Global State\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG\nCONNECTION = None  # Global mutable state\n\ndef get_data():\n    global CONNECTION\n    if not CONNECTION:\n        CONNECTION = create_connection()\n    return CONNECTION.query()\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT\nclass DatabaseService:\n    def __init__(self, connection_pool: ConnectionPool) -> None:\n        self._pool = connection_pool\n    \n    async def get_data(self) -> list[Row]:\n        async with self._pool.acquire() as conn:\n            return await conn.query()\n```\n\n### 6. Nested Loops for Search (O(n\u00b2))\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - O(n\u00b2) complexity\ndef two_sum_slow(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                return (i, j)\n    return None\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT - O(n) with hash map\ndef two_sum_fast(nums: list[int], target: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    seen: dict[int, int] = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:\n            return (seen[complement], i)\n        seen[num] = i\n    return None\n```\n\n### 7. List Instead of Deque for Queue\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - O(n) pop from front\nfrom typing import Any\n\nqueue: list[Any] = [1, 2, 3]\nitem = queue.pop(0)  # O(n) - shifts all elements\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT - O(1) popleft with deque\nfrom collections import deque\n\nqueue: deque[Any] = deque([1, 2, 3])\nitem = queue.popleft()  # O(1)\n```\n\n### 8. Ignoring Async Errors in Gather\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - First exception cancels all tasks\nasync def process_all(tasks: list[Coroutine]) -> list[Any]:\n    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # Raises on first error\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT - Collect all results including errors\nasync def process_all_resilient(tasks: list[Coroutine]) -> list[Any]:\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n    # Handle exceptions separately\n    for i, result in enumerate(results):\n        if isinstance(result, Exception):\n            logger.error(\"Task %d failed: %s\", i, result)\n    return results\n```\n\n### 9. No Timeout for Async Operations\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - May hang indefinitely\nasync def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.get(url) as resp:  # No timeout!\n            return await resp.json()\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT - Always set timeout\nasync def fetch_data_safe(url: str, timeout: float = 10.0) -> dict:\n    async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):  # Python 3.11+\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url) as resp:\n                return await resp.json()\n```\n\n### 10. Inefficient String Concatenation in Loop\n```python\n# \u274c WRONG - O(n\u00b2) due to string immutability\ndef join_words_slow(words: list[str]) -> str:\n    result = \"\"\n    for word in words:\n        result += word + \" \"  # Creates new string each iteration\n    return result.strip()\n\n# \u2705 CORRECT - O(n) with join\ndef join_words_fast(words: list[str]) -> str:\n    return \" \".join(words)\n```\n\n## Memory Categories\n\n**Python Patterns**: Modern idioms, type system usage, async patterns\n**Architecture Decisions**: SOA implementations, DI containers, design patterns\n**Performance Solutions**: Profiling results, optimization techniques, caching strategies\n**Testing Strategies**: pytest patterns, fixtures, property-based testing\n**Type System**: Advanced generics, protocols, validation patterns\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n### Quality Commands\n```bash\n# Auto-fix formatting and imports\nblack . && isort .\n\n# Type checking (strict)\nmypy --strict src/\n\n# Linting\nflake8 src/ --max-line-length=100\n\n# Testing with coverage\npytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=90\n```\n\n### Performance Profiling\n```bash\n# CPU profiling\npython -m cProfile -o profile.stats script.py\npython -m pstats profile.stats\n\n# Memory profiling\npython -m memory_profiler script.py\n\n# Line profiling\nkernprof -l -v script.py\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n**With Engineer**: Cross-language patterns and architectural decisions\n**With QA**: Testing strategies, coverage requirements, quality gates\n**With DevOps**: Deployment, containerization, performance tuning\n**With Data Engineer**: NumPy, pandas, data pipeline optimization\n**With Security**: Security audits, vulnerability scanning, OWASP compliance\n\n## Success Metrics (95% Confidence)\n\n- **Type Safety**: 100% mypy strict compliance\n- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ with comprehensive test suites\n- **Performance**: Profile-driven optimization, documented benchmarks\n- **Code Quality**: PEP 8 compliant, low complexity, well-documented\n- **Production Ready**: Error handling, logging, monitoring, security\n- **Search Utilization**: WebSearch used for all medium-complex problems\n\nAlways prioritize **search-first** for complex problems, **type safety** for reliability, **async patterns** for performance, and **comprehensive testing** for confidence.",
