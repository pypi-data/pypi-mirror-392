           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# CCCC Pair — Modern Multi-Agent Orchestrator

Two always-on AI peers co-drive your repository as equals. They plan, build, critique, and converge through evidence — not just talk. You stay in control via an interactive TUI or your team chat.

**🎯 Production-grade orchestrator** • **🖥️ Zero-config TUI** • **📊 Real-time monitoring** • **🧪 Evidence-driven workflow**

## 🖼️ CCCC at a Glance

![CCCC TUI Screenshot](./screenshots/tui-main.png)

> **Modern terminal interface** with interactive setup wizard, real-time timeline, command completion, and status monitoring — all in one clean layout.

## ✨ What Makes CCCC Different

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**🤝 Dual-Agent Collaboration**
Two equal peers (not solo AI + tools) that challenge each other, surface better options, and catch errors faster.

**🖥️ Interactive TUI with Zero Config**
Point-and-click setup wizard (↑↓ + Enter). No YAML editing. No memorizing commands. Tab completion for everything.

**📊 Real-Time Observability**
Live Timeline shows peer messages. Status panel tracks handoffs, self-checks, and Foreman runs.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**🧪 Evidence-First Workflow**
Only tested patches, stable logs, and commits count as "done". Chat alone never changes state.

**🔗 Multi-Platform Bridges**
Optional Telegram/Slack/Discord integration. Bring the work to where your team already is.

**📋 Repo-Native Anchors**
Strategic board (POR.md) and per-task sheets (SUBPOR.md) live in your repo. Everyone sees the same truth.

## Why CCCC? (The Pain → Payoff)

### Single-Agent Pain Points (You May Recognize These)

- ⏳ **Stalls & Restarts** — Context evaporates between runs; work drifts and repeats
- 💬 **Low-Signal Threads** — Long monologues with little verification, no audit trail
- 🚩 **Vanishing Decisions** — Hard to see what changed, why, and who approved

### CCCC Payoff with Dual Peers & Modern Tooling

- 🤝 **Multi-Peer Synergy** — One builds, the other challenges; better options emerge; errors die faster
- ✅ **Evidence-First Loop** — Only tested/logged/committed results count as progress
- 🖥️ **Interactive TUI** — Zero-config setup, real-time monitoring, command completion built-in
- 📋 **POR/SUBPOR Anchors** — One strategic board (POR) + per-task sheets (SUBPOR) keep everyone aligned without ceremony
- 🔔 **Low-Noise Cadence** — Built-in nudge/self-check trims chatter; panel shows what matters
- 🔍 **Auditable Decisions** — Recent choices & pivots captured; review and roll forward confidently

---

## When to Use CCCC

- You want **autonomous progress you can trust**, with small, reversible steps
- You need **collaboration you can observe** in TUI/IM, not a black box
- Your project benefits from a **living strategic board** and lightweight task sheets in the repo
- You care about **repeatability**: tests, stable logs, and commits as the final word

## Quick Look: TUI Interface Overview

CCCC features a modern, keyboard-driven TUI with two main modes:

### Setup Interface (Interactive Configuration Wizard)

```
┌─ CCCC Setup ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Tab Completion** — Type `/` and press Tab to see all commands
- ✅ **Command History** — Use Up/Down arrows to navigate previous commands
- ✅ **Reverse Search** — Press Ctrl+R to search command history
- ✅ **Rich Shortcuts** — Standard editing keys (Ctrl+A/E/W/U/K) work as expected
- ✅ **Visual Feedback** — Every action shows clear success/error messages

---

## Requirements

- **Python** `>= 3.9`
- **tmux** (`brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`)
- **git**

### Recommended CLI Actors

- 🔵 **Peer A (default)**: Claude Code — Strong reasoning, careful edits, robust long sessions
- 🟡 **Peer B (default)**: Codex CLI — Decisive implementation, fast iteration, stable CLI behavior
- ✨ **Aux (optional)**: Gemini CLI — On-demand helper for burst work (reviews, tests, bulk transforms)

**Also supported**: Factory Droid, OpenCode — All actors can serve as Peer or Aux.

> **Note**: CCCC is vendor-agnostic. Any CLI that follows the simple mailbox contract can participate.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: pipx (Recommended)

```bash
pipx install cccc-pair
```

### Option 2: venv

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install cccc-pair
```

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Initialize Your Repository

```bash
cd your-project
cccc init
```

This creates the `.cccc/` orchestrator domain (gitignored by default) and `docs/por/` anchors.

### 2. Verify Your Environment

```bash
cccc doctor
```

Checks for Python version, tmux, git, and recommended CLI actors.

### 3. (Optional) Connect Team Chat

```bash
cccc token set  # Paste your Telegram bot token (stored securely in .cccc/settings)
```

> Telegram/Slack/Discord bridges are optional. CCCC works perfectly standalone.

### 4. Launch the TUI

```bash
cccc run
```

**What happens:**
- tmux opens with a clean 3-pane layout:
  - **Left**: CCCC TUI (Setup + Timeline + Input + Status)
  - **Top-right**: PeerA terminal
  - **Bottom-right**: PeerB terminal
- **Setup Panel** opens automatically if this is your first run
- **No configuration files to edit** — everything is point-and-click

### 5. Configure Interactively (First Run)

The **Setup Panel** guides you through configuration:

1. **Select Actors** (↑↓ to navigate, Enter to apply):
   - Set `peerA` → `claude`
   - Set `peerB` → `codex`
   - Set `aux` → `none` (or choose an actor for on-demand help)

2. **Verify CLI Availability**:
   - TUI automatically checks if `claude`, `codex`, etc. are on PATH
   - If a CLI is missing, the panel shows hints (e.g., "Install with `pip install claude-code`")

3. **(Optional) Configure Telegram**:
   - If you ran `cccc token set` earlier, you'll see `configured: YES`
   - Otherwise, select `Set token...` to enter your bot token inline

4. **Launch**:
   - Once configured, Setup Panel auto-collapses
   - Focus moves to the Input field
   - Type `/help` (or press Tab) to see all commands

**That's it!** The TUI guides you through the rest.

## Using CCCC TUI

### Setup Panel (Interactive Wizard)

The Setup Panel appears on first launch and can be toggled anytime with `/setup`.

**Navigation:**
- `↑↓` — Move between options
- `Enter` — Apply selection (e.g., bind actor to role)
- `Esc` — Cancel inline input (e.g., token entry)
- `/setup` — Toggle panel visibility

**Features:**
- **Role Binding**: Point-and-click to assign actors to PeerA/PeerB/Aux
- **CLI Check**: Real-time availability status for each actor
- **IM Config**: Set/unset Telegram/Slack/Discord tokens inline
- **Zero YAML Editing**: All changes written to config files automatically

### Runtime Panel (Real-Time Collaboration)

Once Setup is complete, you interact with peers through the Runtime Panel.

**Timeline** (scrollable message stream):
- Displays all messages from PeerA, PeerB, System, and You
- Auto-scrolls to latest, or use `PageUp/PageDown` to review history
- Soft limit: 1200 lines (trims to 800 when exceeded, preserving recent context)

**Input** (command entry with rich features):
- **Tab Completion**: Type `/` and press Tab to see all commands
- **History**: Use `Up/Down` to cycle through previous commands
- **Reverse Search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to search history (like bash/zsh)
- **Standard Editing**: `Ctrl+A/E` (line start/end), `Ctrl+W/U/K` (delete word/start/end)

**Status** (live system info):
- Connection status (● Connected / ○ Disconnected)
- Handoff counts for PeerA/PeerB with next self-check thresholds
- Last update timestamp
- Foreman status (if enabled): next run time, last exit code

---

## Commands Reference

All commands are accessible via Tab completion. Just type `/` and press Tab to explore.

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/help` | Show full command list | `/help` |
| `/a <text>` | Send message to PeerA | `/a Review the auth logic` |
| `/b <text>` | Send message to PeerB | `/b Fix the failing test` |
| `/both <text>` | Send message to both peers | `/both Let's plan the next milestone` |
| `/pause` | Pause handoff loop | `/pause` |
| `/resume` | Resume handoff loop | `/resume` |
| `/refresh` | Refresh system prompts | `/refresh` |
| `/quit` | Exit CCCC (detach tmux) | `/quit` |
| `/setup` | Toggle Setup Panel | `/setup` |
| `/foreman on\|off\|status\|now` | Control Foreman (if enabled) | `/foreman status` |
| `/c <prompt>` | Invoke Aux once | `/c Run full test suite` |
| `/review` | Request Aux review | `/review` |
| `/focus [hint]` | Focus PeerB on a topic | `/focus performance` |
| `/verbose on\|off` | Toggle peer summaries + Foreman CC | `/verbose off` |

### Natural Language Routing

You can also use routing prefixes for natural language input (no slash needed):

```
a: Review the authentication logic and suggest improvements
b: Implement the fix with comprehensive tests
both: Let's discuss the roadmap for next quarter
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

CCCC TUI includes rich keyboard support for efficiency.

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Tab` | Auto-complete commands |
| `Up / Down` | Navigate command history |
| `Ctrl+R` | Reverse search history |
| `Ctrl+A` | Jump to line start |
| `Ctrl+E` | Jump to line end |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete word backward |
| `Ctrl+U` | Delete to line start |
| `Ctrl+K` | Delete to line end |
| `PageUp / PageDown` | Scroll timeline |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear timeline |
| `/quit` | Exit CCCC |
| `Ctrl+B D` | Detach tmux (alternative exit) |

> **Pro tip**: Use `Ctrl+R` to quickly find and re-run previous commands without retyping.

---

## How It Works (Architecture)

### The Core Contract

CCCC uses a simple, file-based mailbox contract:

- **Peers write** `<TO_USER>` and `<TO_PEER>` messages with a trailing fenced `insight` block
- **Messages include**: who (from), kind (claim/counter/evidence/progress), next step, refs (evidence pointers)
- **Evidence types**: patch diffs, test logs, benchmark results, commit hashes
- **State changes**: Only messages with valid evidence (e.g., `patch.diff`, `test:passed`) affect the codebase

### Repo-Native Anchors (POR/SUBPOR)

Strategy and execution live in your repository under `docs/por/`:

- **`POR.md`** (strategic board): North star, deliverables, roadmap (Now/Next/Later), risk radar, recent decisions
- **`T######-slug/SUBPOR.md`** (per-task sheet): Goal, acceptance criteria, cheapest probe, kill criteria, implementation notes, next step

Peers update these naturally as they work. You can read them anytime to see the big picture.

```

**Key Relationships:**
- **User → Peers**: Direct commands or delegated through Foreman (scheduled)
- **Peers ⇄ Aux**: Invoke strategic (POR review) or tactical (tests, bulk work) help as needed
- **Peers → Artifacts**: Generate evidence (patches, tests, logs) directly or via Aux
- **Foreman**: Optional user proxy for periodic health checks and task scheduling
- **Aux**: Optional on-demand helper, invoked by peers for strategic or tactical work

1. **User sends a goal** via TUI or IM (e.g., "Add OAuth support")
2. **PeerA frames intent** (CLAIM) with acceptance criteria and constraints
3. **PeerB counters** with a sharper path or safer rollout
4. **Peers iterate** until consensus, then implement with small patches (≤150 lines)
5. **Evidence gates progress**: Only tested patches, stable logs, and commits count as "done"
6. **Orchestrator logs outcomes** to ledger; status panel updates in real-time

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Compact (Context Compression)

CCCC includes intelligent auto-compact to prevent peer context degradation during long-running sessions.

**How it works:**
- **Idle Detection**: Automatically detects when peers are idle (no inflight messages, no queued work, sufficient silence)
- **Work Threshold**: Only triggers after meaningful work (≥6 messages exchanged since last compact)
- **Interval Gating**: Respects minimum time interval (default: 15 minutes) to avoid wasteful compaction
- **Per-Actor Support**: Each CLI actor declares compact capability in `agents.yaml` (e.g., `/compact` for Claude Code, `/compress` for Gemini CLI)

**Configuration** (in `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml`):
```yaml
delivery:
  auto_compact:
    enabled: true                    # Global toggle
    min_interval_seconds: 900        # Wait 15 min between compacts
    min_messages_since_last: 6       # Require ≥6 messages of work
    idle_threshold_seconds: 120      # Peer must be idle for 2 min
    check_interval_seconds: 120       # Check every 2 minutes
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintains peer mental clarity across multi-hour sessions
- Prevents context window bloat and token waste
- Zero manual intervention — works automatically in the background

**Diagnostics:**
- Check `.cccc/state/ledger.jsonl` for `auto-compact` and `auto-compact-skip` events
- Logs include reason codes (e.g., `insufficient-messages`, `not-idle`, `time-interval`)

---

### Aux (Optional On-Demand Helper)

Aux is a third peer for burst work (e.g., broad reviews, heavy tests, bulk transforms).

**Enable at startup:**
- In Setup Panel, select an actor for `aux` (e.g., `gemini`)
- Or set `aux→none` to disable

**Invoke Aux:**
- In TUI: `/c <prompt>` or `/review`
- In chat bridges: `/aux-cli "<prompt>"`

**Use cases:**
- Strategic reviews (check POR against all SUBPORs)
- Heavy lifting (run full test suites, generate bulk fixtures)
- External checks (dependency audits, security scans)

**Note**: Aux runs once per invocation. No persistent state between runs.

### Foreman (User Proxy)

Foreman is a lightweight "user proxy" that runs on a timer (default: 15 minutes) and performs one non-interactive task or writes one short user-voice request to the right peer.

**Enable at startup:**
- In Setup Panel, choose an actor for Foreman (or `none` to disable)
- You can reuse Aux actor or pick a different one

**Configure:**
- Edit `./FOREMAN_TASK.md` (free-form: describe what matters now and list standing tasks)
- System rules live at `.cccc/rules/FOREMAN.md` (auto-generated, no manual edits)

**Visibility:**
- Status panel shows: `Foreman: RUNNING | last @ HH:MM rc=N | next @ HH:MM`
- IM shows messages as `[FOREMAN→PeerA]` or `[FOREMAN→PeerB]`

**Controls:**
- `/foreman on|off|status|now` (only if Foreman was enabled at startup)
- `/verbose on|off` toggles Foreman CC to chat

**Use cases:**
- Periodic health checks (run tests every 30 minutes)
- Reminder to update POR/SUBPORs
- Enforce quality gates (lint, type-check before commit)

## IM Bridges (Telegram/Slack/Discord)

CCCC includes optional chat bridges to bring the work to where your team already is.

### Features

- **Routing**: Use `a:`, `b:`, or `both:` prefixes, or `/a`, `/b`, `/both` commands
- **File Exchange**: Upload files to peers, download outputs from `.cccc/work/upload/outbound/`
- **RFD Cards**: Inline approval buttons for Request-For-Decision cards
- **Peer Summaries**: Optional (toggle with `/showpeers on|off`)

### Setup

1. **Create a bot** (Telegram: @BotFather, Slack: App Studio, Discord: Developer Portal)
2. **Set token**:
   ```bash
   cccc token set  # Or via TUI Setup Panel
   ```
3. **Allowlist your chat**:
   - Start a conversation with the bot, send `/whoami` to get your `chat_id`
   - Add `chat_id` to `.cccc/settings/telegram.yaml` (or slack.yaml/discord.yaml) allowlist
4. **Autostart** (optional):
   - Set `autostart: true` in config to launch bridge with `cccc run`

### Commands in Chat

- `/help` — Usage and routing tips
- `/whoami` — Get your `chat_id` for allowlist
- `/status` — View orchestrator snapshot
- `/showpeers on|off` — Toggle peer↔peer summaries
- `/files [in|out] [N]` — List recent files
- `a: <message>` — Send to PeerA
- `b: <message>` — Send to PeerB
- `both: <message>` — Send to both

---

## A Typical Session (End-to-End, ~3 Minutes)

### 1. Explore (Short)

In TUI or chat, route an idea to both peers:

```
both: Add a short section to README about team chat tips
```

- PeerA frames intent
- PeerB asks one focused question

### 2. Decide (Concise CLAIM)

- PeerA writes a CLAIM in `to_peer.md` with acceptance criteria and constraints
- PeerB COUNTERs with a sharper path or safer rollout

### 3. Build (Evidence-First)

- Peers propose small, verifiable changes with 1-2 line EVIDENCE notes:
  - `tests OK` / `stable logs` / `commit:abc123`
- Orchestrator logs outcomes to ledger
- Status panel updates

### 4. Team Visibility

- Telegram/Slack/Discord (if enabled) receive concise summaries
- Peers stay quiet unless blocked

### Cadence

- **Self-Check**: Every N handoffs (configurable, default 20), orchestrator triggers a short alignment check
- **POR Update**: PeerB receives periodic reminders to review `POR.md` and all active `SUBPOR.md` files
- **Auto-Compact**: When peers are idle after sufficient work, orchestrator automatically compacts context (default: ≥6 messages, 15 min interval, 2 min idle)
- **Foreman Runs**: Every 15 minutes (if enabled), Foreman performs one standing task or writes one request

## Configuration

CCCC follows "convention over configuration" principles. Sensible defaults work out of the box.

### Key Config Files (All in `.cccc/settings/`)

- **`cli_profiles.yaml`** — Actor bindings, roles, delivery settings (mailbox, nudge, keepalive, auto-compact)
- **`agents.yaml`** — CLI actor definitions and capabilities (compact support, commands, IO profiles)
- **`policies.yaml`** — Strategic policies (autonomy level, handoff filters)
- **`telegram.yaml`** — Telegram bridge config (token, allowlist, routing)
- **`slack.yaml`** — Slack bridge config (similar structure)
- **`discord.yaml`** — Discord bridge config (similar structure)
- **`foreman.yaml`** — Foreman agent and cadence

**No manual editing required** — TUI Setup Panel handles all common changes. Advanced users can tweak YAML directly for fine-grained control.

### Environment Variables (Optional Overrides)

- `CLAUDE_I_CMD` — Override default `claude` command (e.g., `claude-dev`)
- `CODEX_I_CMD` — Override default `codex` command
- `GEMINI_I_CMD` — Override default `gemini` command
- `CCCC_HOME` — Override default `.cccc` directory path

## FAQ

### Do I need to learn all the commands?

**No!** The Setup Panel uses point-and-click (↑↓ + Enter). Tab completion helps with commands in the Runtime Panel. Type `/help` anytime to see everything.

### Can I use CCCC without Telegram/Slack/Discord?

**Yes!** TUI works perfectly standalone. IM bridges are optional and add team collaboration, but they're not required.

### Does CCCC lock me into a specific UI?

**No.** Tmux TUI is the default, but the orchestrator is transport-agnostic. You can interact via TUI, IM bridges, or even direct file writes to the mailbox.

### What if I prefer typing commands over point-and-click?

**Go for it!** The Setup Panel is for convenience. Power users can use slash commands (e.g., `/a`, `/b`) or natural language routing (e.g., `a: Fix the bug`) exclusively.

### Can I run CCCC only locally (no cloud services)?

**Yes.** Everything works without any bridge. Peers run locally via CLI actors. No cloud dependencies unless you explicitly configure IM bridges.

### What about safety?

- **Chats never change state** directly — only evidence (patches/tests/logs) does
- **"Done" means verified** — tests passed, logs stable, commit referenced
- **Irreversible changes** (schema, public API, releases) require explicit dual-sign from both peers
- **Soft path locks** prevent overlapping changes
- **Ledger audit trail** records every state transition

### How do I customize system prompts?

- Edit `PROJECT.md` at repo root (your project brief)
- Edit `.cccc/rules/PEERA.md` or `.cccc/rules/PEERB.md` (auto-generated, but safe to tweak)
- Run `/refresh` in TUI to reload prompts

### What if a CLI actor is missing?

- TUI Setup Panel shows real-time availability checks
- If a CLI is missing, you'll see hints like "Install with `pip install claude-code`"
- Orchestrator won't start missing actors — right pane stays blank until CLI is available

### Can I swap actors mid-session?

**Not yet.** Actors are bound at startup via Setup Panel. To change, exit (`/quit`) and restart `cccc run`. Future versions may support hot-swapping.

### How do I debug orchestrator issues?

- Check `.cccc/state/status.json` for current state
- Check `.cccc/state/ledger.jsonl` for event log (includes auto-compact events with detailed diagnostics)
- Check `.cccc/state/orchestrator.log` for runtime logs
- Check `.cccc/logs/*.log` for detailed peer outputs
- Run `cccc doctor` to verify environment

### How do I troubleshoot auto-compact?

**Check if it's working:**
```bash
grep "auto-compact" .cccc/state/ledger.jsonl | tail -20
```

**Common skip reasons:**
- `insufficient-messages` — Peer hasn't done enough work yet (< 6 messages)
- `not-idle` — Peer has inflight/queued messages or hasn't been silent for 2 minutes
- `time-interval` — Not enough time since last compact (< 15 minutes)
- `actor-compact-disabled` — CLI actor doesn't support compact (check `agents.yaml`)

**Adjust thresholds** in `.cccc/settings/cli_profiles.yaml` under `delivery.auto_compact`

### Where can I see real-world examples?

Open an issue or start a discussion in the repo. We love shipping with teams who care about clarity, evidence, and taste.
