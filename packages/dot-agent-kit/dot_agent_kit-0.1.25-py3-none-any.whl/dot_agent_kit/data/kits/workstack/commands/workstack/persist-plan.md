description: Extract plan from conversation, fully enhance it, and save to disk
---

# /persist-plan

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This command ONLY saves the plan - it does NOT create worktrees or implement code!**

## Goal

**Extract an implementation plan from conversation, enhance it for autonomous execution, and save it to disk.**

This command extracts a plan from conversation context, optionally applies guidance, interactively enhances it through clarifying questions, and saves it to the repository root as a markdown file.

**What this command does:**

- ✅ Find plan in conversation
- ✅ Apply optional guidance to plan
- ✅ Interactively enhance plan for autonomous execution
- ✅ Extract semantic understanding and context
- ✅ Structure complex plans into phases (when beneficial)
- ✅ Save enhanced plan to disk

**What happens AFTER (in separate commands):**

- ⏭️ Create worktree: `/create-planned-stack`
- ⏭️ Switch and implement: `workstack switch <name> && claude --permission-mode acceptEdits "/workstack:implement-plan"`

## What Happens

When you run this command, these steps occur:

1. **Verify Scope** - Confirm we're in a git repository
2. **Detect Plan** - Search conversation for implementation plan
3. **Apply Guidance** - Merge optional guidance into plan (if provided)
4. **Extract Understanding** - Capture semantic understanding from planning discussion
5. **Interactive Enhancement** - Analyze plan and ask clarifying questions if needed
6. **Generate Filename** - Derive filename from plan title
7. **Detect Root** - Find repository root directory
8. **Save Plan** - Write enhanced plan to disk as markdown file

## Usage

```bash
/persist-plan [guidance]
```

**Examples:**

- `/persist-plan` - Save enhanced plan to disk
- `/persist-plan "Make error handling more robust and add retry logic"` - Apply guidance to plan
- `/persist-plan "Fix: Use LBYL instead of try/except throughout"` - Apply corrections to plan

## Prerequisites

- An implementation plan must exist in conversation
- Current working directory must be in a git repository
- (Optional) Guidance text for final corrections/additions to the plan

## Semantic Understanding & Context Preservation

**Why This Matters:** Planning agents often discover valuable insights that would be expensive for implementing agents to re-derive. Capturing this context saves time and prevents errors.

**What to Capture:**

1. **API/Tool Quirks**
   - Undocumented behaviors, race conditions, timing issues
   - Example: "Stripe webhooks can arrive before API response returns"
   - Include: Why it matters, how to handle, what to watch for

2. **Architectural Insights**
   - WHY code is structured certain ways (not just how)
   - Design boundaries and their rationale
   - Example: "Config split across files due to circular imports"

3. **Domain Logic & Business Rules**
   - Non-obvious invariants, edge cases, compliance requirements
   - Example: "Never delete audit records, only mark as archived"
   - Include: Rationale, validation criteria, edge cases

4. **Complex Reasoning**
   - Alternatives considered and rejected with reasons
   - Dependencies between choices
   - Example: "Can't use async here because parent caller is sync"

5. **Known Pitfalls**
   - Anti-patterns that seem right but cause problems
   - Framework-specific gotchas
   - Example: "Don't use .resolve() before checking .exists()"

6. **Raw Discoveries Log**
   - Everything discovered during planning, even if minor
   - Examples: Version numbers, config formats, conventions observed

7. **Planning Artifacts**
   - Code snippets examined, commands run, configurations discovered
   - Example: "Checked auth.py lines 45-67 for validation pattern"

8. **Implementation Risks**
   - Technical debt, uncertainties, performance concerns, security considerations
   - Example: "No caching layer could cause issues at scale"

**Inclusion Philosophy:** Cast a wide net - over-document rather than under-document. Include anything that:

- Took ANY time to discover (even 30 seconds of research)
- MIGHT influence implementation decisions
- Could POSSIBLY cause bugs or confusion
- Wasn't immediately obvious on first glance
- Required any clarification or discussion
- Involved ANY decision between alternatives
- Required looking at documentation or examples

**Remember:** It's easier for implementing agents to skip irrelevant context than to rediscover missing context. When in doubt, include it.

**How It's Used:** This understanding gets captured in the "Context & Understanding" section of enhanced plans, linked to specific implementation steps.

## Success Criteria

This command succeeds when ALL of the following are true:

**Plan Extraction:**
✅ Implementation plan extracted from conversation context
✅ If guidance provided, it has been applied to the plan
✅ Semantic understanding extracted and integrated

**File Creation:**
✅ Plan saved to `<repo-root>/<filename>-plan.md`
✅ File is valid markdown and contains enhanced content

**Output:**
✅ JSON output provided with file path and status
✅ Next steps clearly communicated to user

## Troubleshooting

### "No plan found in context"

**Cause:** Plan not in conversation or doesn't match detection patterns
**Solution:**

- Ensure plan is in conversation history
- Plan should have headers like "## Implementation Plan" or numbered steps
- Re-paste plan in conversation if needed

### "Plan file already exists"

**Cause:** File with same name exists at repository root
**Solution:**

- Change plan title to generate different filename
- Delete existing file: `rm <repo-root>/<filename>-plan.md`

### Enhancement suggestions not applied correctly

**Cause:** Ambiguous user responses or misinterpretation
**Solution:**

- Be specific in responses to clarifying questions
- Use clear action words: "Fix:", "Add:", "Change:", "Reorder:"

---

## Agent Instructions

You are executing the `/persist-plan` command. Follow these steps carefully:

### Step 0: Verify Scope and Constraints

**Error Handling Template:**
All errors must follow this format:

```
❌ Error: [Brief description in 5-10 words]

Details: [Specific error message, relevant context, or diagnostic info]

Suggested action: [1-3 concrete steps to resolve]
```

**YOUR ONLY TASKS:**

1. Extract implementation plan from conversation
2. Apply guidance modifications if provided
3. Extract semantic understanding from planning discussion
4. Interactively enhance plan for autonomous execution
5. Save enhanced plan to disk as markdown file
6. Provide JSON output with file path

**FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:**

- Writing ANY code files (.py, .ts, .js, etc.)
- Making ANY edits to existing codebase
- Creating ANY worktrees
- Running ANY commands except `git rev-parse`
- Implementing ANY part of the plan

This command only saves the plan. Worktree creation happens via `/create-planned-stack`.

### Step 1: Detect Implementation Plan in Context

Search conversation history for an implementation plan:

**Search strategy:**

1. Work backwards from most recent messages
2. Stop at first complete plan found
3. Look for markdown content with structure

**What constitutes a complete plan:**

- Minimum 100 characters
- Contains headers (# or ##) OR numbered lists OR bulleted lists
- Has title/overview AND implementation steps

**Common plan patterns:**

- Markdown with "Implementation Plan:", "Overview", "Implementation Steps"
- Structured task lists or step-by-step instructions
- Headers containing "Plan", "Tasks", "Steps", "Implementation"

**If no plan found:**

```
❌ Error: No implementation plan found in conversation

Details: Could not find a valid implementation plan in conversation history

Suggested action:
  1. Ensure plan is in conversation
  2. Plan should have headers and structure
  3. Re-paste plan in conversation if needed
```

**Plan validation:**

- Must be at least 100 characters
- Must contain structure (numbered lists, bulleted lists, or multiple headers)
- If invalid, show error:

```
❌ Error: Plan content is too minimal or invalid

Details: Plan lacks structure or implementation details

Suggested action:
  1. Provide a more detailed implementation plan
  2. Include specific tasks, steps, or phases
  3. Use headers and lists to structure the plan
```

### Step 2: Apply Optional Guidance to Plan

**Check for guidance argument:**

If guidance text is provided as an argument to this command:

**Guidance Classification and Merging Algorithm:**

1. **Correction** - Fixes errors in approach
   - Pattern: "Fix:", "Correct:", "Use X instead of Y"
   - Action: Update relevant sections in-place
   - Example: "Fix: Use LBYL not try/except" → Replace exception handling approaches throughout

2. **Addition** - New requirements or features
   - Pattern: "Add:", "Include:", "Also implement"
   - Action: Add new subsections or steps
   - Example: "Add retry logic to API calls" → Insert new step or enhance existing API steps

3. **Clarification** - More detail or specificity
   - Pattern: "Make X more", "Ensure", "Specifically"
   - Action: Enhance existing steps with details
   - Example: "Make error messages user-friendly" → Add detail to error handling sections

4. **Reordering** - Priority or sequence changes
   - Pattern: "Do X before Y", "Prioritize", "Start with"
   - Action: Restructure order of steps
   - Example: "Do validation before processing" → Move validation steps earlier

**Integration Process:**

1. Parse guidance to identify type(s)
2. Find relevant sections in plan
3. Apply transformations contextually (not just appending)
4. Preserve plan structure and formatting
5. Maintain coherent flow

**Edge cases:**

**Guidance without plan in context:**

```
❌ Error: Cannot apply guidance - no plan found in context

Details: Guidance provided: "[first 100 chars of guidance]"

Suggested action:
  1. First create or present an implementation plan
  2. Then run: /persist-plan "your guidance here"
```

**Multi-line guidance limitation:**
Note: Guidance must be provided as a single-line string in quotes. Multi-line guidance is not supported.

If no guidance provided: use the original plan as-is

**Output:** Final plan content (original or modified) ready for Step 3 processing

### Step 3: Extract and Preserve Semantic Understanding

Analyze the planning discussion to extract valuable context that implementing agents would find expensive to rediscover. Use the structured template sections to organize discoveries.

**Context Preservation Criteria:**
Include items that meet ANY of these:

- Took ANY time to discover (even 30 seconds of research)
- MIGHT influence implementation decisions
- Could POSSIBLY cause bugs or confusion
- Wasn't immediately obvious on first glance
- Required any clarification or discussion
- Involved ANY decision between alternatives
- Required looking at documentation or examples

**Extraction Process:**

1. **Extract EVERYTHING first** - Do a complete pass capturing every single discovery, decision, clarification, or piece of information learned
2. **Organize into categories** - Sort the raw extractions into the appropriate sections
3. **Apply minimal filtering** - Only remove true duplicates and completely irrelevant items (like "user said hello")
4. **Add a catch-all section** - Include "Other Discoveries" for items that don't fit categories
5. **Document the planning process itself** - What research was done, what sources were consulted, what experiments were run

**For each dimension, systematically check the planning discussion:**

#### 1. API/Tool Quirks

Look for discoveries about external systems, libraries, or tools:

Questions to ask:

- Did we discover undocumented behaviors or edge cases?
- Are there timing issues, race conditions, or ordering constraints?
- Did we find version-specific gotchas or compatibility issues?
- Are there performance characteristics that affect design?

Examples to extract:

- "Stripe webhooks often arrive BEFORE API response returns to client"
- "PostgreSQL foreign keys must be created in dependency order within same migration"
- "WebSocket API doesn't guarantee message order for sends <10ms apart"
- "SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN in versions before 3.35"

#### 2. Architectural Insights

Look for WHY behind design decisions:

Questions to ask:

- Why was this architectural pattern chosen over alternatives?
- What constraints led to this design?
- How do components interact in non-obvious ways?
- What's the reasoning behind the sequencing or phasing?

Examples to extract:

- "Zero-downtime deployment requires 4-phase migration to maintain rollback capability"
- "State machine pattern prevents invalid state transitions from webhook retries"
- "Webhook handlers MUST be idempotent because Stripe retries for up to 3 days"
- "Database transactions scoped per-webhook-event, not per-API-call, to prevent partial updates"

#### 3. Domain Logic & Business Rules

Look for non-obvious requirements and rules:

Questions to ask:

- Are there business rules that aren't obvious from code?
- What edge cases or special conditions apply?
- Are there compliance, security, or regulatory requirements?
- What assumptions about user behavior or data affect implementation?

Examples to extract:

- "Failed payments trigger 7-day grace period before service suspension, not immediate cutoff"
- "Admin users must retain ALL permissions during migration - partial loss creates security incident"
- "Default permissions for new users during migration must be fail-closed, not empty"
- "Tax calculation must happen before payment intent creation to ensure correct amounts"

#### 4. Complex Reasoning

Look for alternatives considered and decision rationale:

Questions to ask:

- What approaches were considered but rejected?
- Why were certain solutions ruled out?
- What tradeoffs were evaluated?
- How did we arrive at the chosen approach?

Format as:

- **Rejected**: [Approach]
  - Reason: [Why it doesn't work]
  - Also: [Additional concerns]
- **Chosen**: [Selected approach]
  - [Why this works better]

Examples to extract:

- "**Rejected**: Synchronous payment confirmation (waiting for webhook in API call)
  - Reason: Webhooks can take 1-30 seconds, creates timeout issues
  - Also: Connection failures would lose webhook delivery entirely"
- "**Rejected**: Database-level locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE)
  - Reason: Lock held during entire edit session causes head-of-line blocking"
- "**Chosen**: Optimistic locking with version numbers
  - Detects conflicts without blocking, better for real-time collaboration"

#### 5. Known Pitfalls

Look for specific gotchas and anti-patterns:

Questions to ask:

- What looks correct but actually causes problems?
- Are there subtle bugs waiting to happen?
- What mistakes did we avoid during planning?
- What would be easy to get wrong during implementation?

Format as "DO NOT [anti-pattern] - [why it breaks]"

Examples to extract:

- "DO NOT use payment_intent.succeeded event alone - fires even for zero-amount test payments. Check amount > 0."
- "DO NOT store Stripe objects directly in database - schema changes across API versions. Extract needed fields only."
- "DO NOT assume webhook delivery order - charge.succeeded might arrive before payment_intent.succeeded"
- "DO NOT use document.updated_at for version checking - clock skew and same-ms races cause false conflicts"
- "DO NOT migrate superuser permissions first - if migration fails, you've locked out recovery access"

#### 6. Raw Discoveries Log

Capture EVERYTHING discovered during planning, even if it seems minor:

Questions to ask:

- What did we look up or verify?
- What assumptions did we validate?
- What small details did we clarify?
- What documentation did we reference?
- What examples did we examine?

Format as bullet points without filtering:

- Discovered: SQLite version on system is 3.39
- Confirmed: pytest is already in requirements.txt
- Learned: The codebase uses pathlib, not os.path
- Checked: No existing rate limiting on API endpoints
- Found: Tests use unittest not pytest style
- Verified: Python 3.11 is the minimum version
- Noted: All configs are YAML not JSON
- Observed: Error messages follow RFC7807 format
- Clarified: User model is in models/user.py not auth/models.py
- Researched: Stripe webhook signature verification requires raw body bytes
- Discovered: Project uses Black formatter with 88 char line length
- Found: All API responses use snake_case not camelCase
- Verified: Database migrations run automatically on deploy
- Learned: Redis is used for caching but not sessions

#### 7. Planning Artifacts

Preserve any code snippets, commands, or configurations discovered during planning:

**Commands Run:**

- `pip list | grep stripe` → Found stripe==5.4.0
- `git log --oneline -5` → Verified recent commit patterns
- `python --version` → Python 3.11.6

**Code Examined:**

- Looked at auth.py lines 45-67 for validation pattern
- Reviewed test_utils.py for test fixture approach
- Checked settings.py for database configuration

**Config Samples:**

- Database connection: `postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db`
- Redis settings: `{"host": "localhost", "port": 6379}`
- API rate limit: 100 requests per minute

**Error Messages Encountered:**

- "ImportError: circular import" when trying direct import
- "TypeError: can't pickle" with multiprocessing approach
- "ValidationError: field required" for missing user_id

#### 8. Implementation Risks & Concerns

Document any worries, uncertainties, or potential issues identified during planning:

**Technical Debt:**

- The auth system is tightly coupled to user model
- No abstraction layer between API and database
- Tests are not parallelizable due to shared fixtures

**Uncertainty Areas:**

- Not sure if webhook endpoint needs CSRF protection
- Unclear if rate limiting applies to admin users
- Don't know if database can handle expected load

**Performance Concerns:**

- Bulk operations might timeout with current 30s limit
- No caching layer could cause issues at scale
- N+1 queries likely in user list endpoint

**Security Considerations:**

- API keys stored in plain text in dev config
- No audit logging for permission changes
- CORS settings might be too permissive

**Output:** Enhanced plan with populated Context & Understanding sections, ready for Step 4 interactive enhancement

### Step 4: Interactive Plan Enhancement

Analyze the plan for common ambiguities and ask clarifying questions when helpful. Focus on practical improvements that make implementation clearer.

#### Code in Plans: Behavioral, Not Literal

**Rule:** Plans describe WHAT to do, not HOW to code it.

**Include in plans:**

- File paths and function names
- Behavioral requirements
- Success criteria
- Error handling approaches

**Only include code snippets for:**

- Security-critical implementations
- Public API signatures
- Bug fixes showing exact before/after
- Database schema changes

**Example:**
❌ Wrong: `def validate_user(user_id: str | None) -> User: ...`
✅ Right: "Update validate_user() in src/auth.py to use LBYL pattern, check for None, raise appropriate errors"

#### Analyze Plan for Gaps

Examine the plan for common ambiguities:

**Common gaps to look for:**

1. **Vague file references**: "the config file", "update the model", "modify the API"
   - Need: Exact file paths

2. **Unclear operations**: "improve", "optimize", "refactor", "enhance"
   - Need: Specific actions and metrics

3. **Missing success criteria**: Steps without clear completion conditions
   - Need: Testable outcomes

4. **Unspecified dependencies**: External services, APIs, packages mentioned without details
   - Need: Availability, versions, fallbacks

5. **Large scope indicators**:
   - Multiple distinct features
   - Multiple unrelated components
   - Complex interdependencies
   - Need: Consider phase decomposition

6. **Missing reasoning context**: "use the better approach", "handle carefully"
   - Need: Which approach was chosen and WHY
   - Need: What "carefully" means specifically

7. **Vague constraints**: "ensure compatibility", "maintain performance"
   - Need: Specific versions, standards, or metrics
   - Need: Quantifiable requirements

8. **Hidden complexity**: Steps that seem simple but aren't
   - Need: Document discovered complexity
   - Need: Explain non-obvious requirements

#### Ask Clarifying Questions

For gaps identified, ask the user specific questions. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to get answers.

**Question format examples:**

```markdown
I need to clarify a few details to improve the plan:

**File Locations:**
The plan mentions "update the user model" - which specific file contains this model?

- Example: `models/user.py` or `src/database/models.py`

**Success Criteria:**
Phase 2 mentions "improve performance" - what specific metrics should I target?

- Example: "Response time < 200ms" or "Memory usage < 100MB"

**External Dependencies:**
The plan references "the payments API" - which service is this?

- Example: "Stripe API v2" or "Internal billing service at /api/billing"
```

**Context Mining Questions:**

To ensure we've captured all valuable discoveries from our planning discussion:

**What did we learn about the codebase?**

- Any patterns, conventions, or structures we discovered?
- Example: "All services inherit from BaseService class"
- Example: "Database queries use raw SQL, not ORM"

**What external resources did we reference?**

- Documentation, examples, or discussions we looked at?
- Example: "Checked Stripe docs for webhook retry behavior"
- Example: "Referenced Stack Overflow for datetime handling"

**What assumptions did we validate or invalidate?**

- Things that turned out different than expected?
- Example: "Thought we could use async but parent is sync"
- Example: "Expected JSON configs but found YAML"

**What small details matter?**

- Minor things that could trip up implementation?
- Example: "Import order matters due to circular deps"
- Example: "Must use double quotes in SQL, not single"

**Important:**

- Ask all clarifying questions in one interaction (batch them)
- Make questions specific and provide examples
- Allow user to skip questions if they prefer ambiguity
- Context questions should focus on discoveries made during planning, not theoretical concerns

#### Check for Semantic Understanding

After clarifying questions, check if you discovered valuable context during planning (see "Semantic Understanding & Context Preservation" section). If relevant, include it in the plan's "Context & Understanding" section.

#### Suggest Phase Decomposition (When Helpful)

For complex plans with multiple distinct features or components, suggest breaking into phases:

**IMPORTANT - Testing and validation:**

- Testing and validation are ALWAYS bundled within implementation phases
- Never create separate phases for "add tests" or "run validation"
- Each phase is an independently testable commit with its own tests
- Only decompose when business logic complexity genuinely requires it
- Tests are part of the deliverable for each phase, not afterthoughts

**Phase structure suggestion:**

```markdown
This plan would benefit from phase-based implementation. Here's a suggested breakdown:

**Phase 1: Data Layer** [branch: feature-data]

- Create models and migrations
- Add unit tests
- Deliverable: Working database schema with tests

**Phase 2: API Endpoints** [branch: feature-api]

- Implement REST endpoints
- Add integration tests
- Deliverable: Functional API with test coverage

**Phase 3: Frontend Integration** [branch: feature-ui]

- Update UI components
- Add e2e tests
- Deliverable: Complete feature with UI

Each phase will be a separate branch that can be tested independently.
Would you like to structure the plan this way? (I can adjust the phases if needed)
```

#### Incorporate Enhancements

Based on user responses:

1. **Update file references** with exact paths
2. **Replace vague terms** with specific actions
3. **Add success criteria** to each major step
4. **Structure into phases** if helpful
5. **Include test requirements** where appropriate

#### Plan Templates

```

#### Apply Hybrid Context Linking

Before finalizing the plan, ensure context is properly linked to implementation steps:

**Linking Strategy:**

1. **Inline [CRITICAL:] tags** - For must-not-miss warnings in steps
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Breaking changes
   - Data loss risks
   - Irreversible operations
   - Race conditions or timing requirements

   Example:

   ```markdown
   1. **Create database migration**: Add migration 0001_initial.py
      [CRITICAL: Run backup BEFORE migration. Irreversible schema change.]
   ```

2. **"Related Context:" subsections** - For detailed explanations
   - Link to relevant Context & Understanding sections
   - Explain WHY this approach was chosen
   - Document discovered constraints or gotchas
   - Reference rejected alternatives

   Example:

   ```markdown
   Related Context:

   - Migration is 4-phase to allow rollback (see Architectural Insights)
   - Foreign keys must be created in dependency order (see API/Tool Quirks)
   - See Known Pitfalls for DROP COLUMN version constraint
   ```

**Validation Checklist:**

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] EVERY implementation step has at least one context reference (even if minor)
- [ ] Any step touching external services references relevant quirks
- [ ] Any step with alternatives documents why this approach was chosen
- [ ] Security-critical operations have inline [CRITICAL:] warnings
- [ ] Each Context & Understanding item is referenced by at least one step
- [ ] No orphaned context (context without corresponding steps)
- [ ] Context items are specific and actionable, not vague generalizations

**Orphaned Context Handling:**

If context items don't map to any implementation step:

- Either: Add implementation steps that use this context
- Or: Remove the context item (it's probably not relevant)

Context should drive implementation. If context doesn't connect to steps, it's either missing steps or irrelevant.

#### Final Review

Present a final review of potential execution issues (not a quality score):

```markdown
## Plan Review - Potential Execution Issues

🟡 **Ambiguous reference: "the main configuration"**
Impact: Agent won't know which file to modify
Suggested fix: Specify exact path (e.g., `config/settings.py`)
[Fix Now] [Continue Anyway]

🟡 **No test coverage specified for new endpoints**
Impact: Can't verify implementation works correctly
Suggested fix: Add test requirements for each endpoint
[Add Tests] [Skip]

🔴 **Database migration lacks rollback strategy**
Impact: Failed migration could leave database in broken state
Suggested fix: Include rollback procedure or backup strategy
[Add Rollback] [Accept Risk]
```

**Key principles:**

- Only flag issues that would genuinely block execution
- Provide concrete impact statements
- Let users dismiss warnings
- Don't use percentages or scores
- Focus on actionability

**Output:** Final enhanced plan content ready for Step 5 processing

### Step 5: Generate Filename from Plan

**Filename Extraction Algorithm:**

1. **Try H1 header** - Look for `# Title` at start of document
2. **Try H2 header** - Look for `## Title` if no H1
3. **Try prefix patterns** - Look for text after "Plan:", "Implementation Plan:"
4. **Fallback to first line** - Use first non-empty line as last resort

**Validation and Cleanup:**

1. Extract raw title using above priority
2. Convert to lowercase
3. Replace spaces with hyphens
4. Remove all special characters except hyphens and alphanumeric
5. Handle Unicode: Normalize to NFC, remove emojis/special symbols
6. Strip any trailing hyphens or slashes: `base_name = base_name.rstrip('-/')`
7. Ensure at least one alphanumeric character remains

**No length restriction:** DO NOT truncate the base name. The base name is limited to 30 characters by `sanitize_worktree_name()`, but the final name (with date suffix) can exceed 30 characters. Workstack no longer truncates after adding the date suffix.

**Resulting names:**

- Filename: `<kebab-case-base>-plan.md` (any length - no LLM truncation)
- Worktree name: `<kebab-case-base>-YY-MM-DD` (base ≤30 chars, final can be ~39 chars)
- Branch name: `<kebab-case-base>-YY-MM-DD` (matches worktree exactly)

**If extraction fails:**

If cleanup results in empty string or no alphanumeric chars, prompt the user:

```
❌ Error: Could not extract valid plan name from title

Details: Plan title contains only special characters or is empty

Suggested action:
  1. Add a clear title to your plan (e.g., # Feature Name)
  2. Or provide a name: What would you like to name this plan?
```

Use AskUserQuestion tool to get the plan name from the user if extraction fails.

**Example transformations:**

- "User Authentication System" →
  - Base: `user-authentication-system` (27 chars)
  - Filename: `user-authentication-system-plan.md`
  - Worktree & Branch: `user-authentication-system-25-11-09` (36 chars - exceeds 30!)

- "Version-Specific Dignified Python Kits Structure" →
  - Base: `version-dignified-python-kits` (29 chars, intelligently shortened)
  - Rationale: Removed "specific", "structure"; kept key terms
  - Filename: `version-dignified-python-kits-plan.md`
  - Worktree & Branch: `version-dignified-python-kits-25-11-09` (38 chars - exceeds 30!)

- "Fix: Database Connection Issues" →
  - Base: `fix-database-connection-issues` (30 chars)
  - Filename: `fix-database-connection-issues-plan.md`
  - Worktree & Branch: `fix-database-connection-issues-25-11-09` (39 chars - at max!)

- "🚀 Awesome Feature!!!" →
  - Base: `awesome-feature` (15 chars, emojis removed)
  - Filename: `awesome-feature-plan.md`
  - Worktree & Branch: `awesome-feature-25-11-09` (24 chars)

### Step 6: Detect Repository Root

Execute: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

This returns the absolute path to the root of the current repository. Store this as `<repo-root>` for use in subsequent steps.

**If the command fails:**

```
❌ Error: Could not detect repository root

Details: Not in a git repository or git command failed

Suggested action:
  1. Ensure you are in a valid git repository
  2. Run: git status (to verify git is working)
  3. Check if .git directory exists
```

### Step 7: Save Plan to Disk

**Pre-save validation:**

1. **Verify filename base length** (CRITICAL):
   - Extract base name from `<derived-filename>` (remove `-plan.md` suffix)
   - MUST be ≤ 30 characters
   - If > 30 characters, this is an implementation bug - the filename generation in Step 5 failed

```
❌ Error: Internal error - filename base exceeds 30 characters

Details: Generated base name '<base>' is <length> characters (max: 30)

This is a bug in the filename generation algorithm. The base should have been
truncated to 30 characters in Step 5.

Suggested action:
  1. Report this as a bug in /persist-plan
  2. Manually truncate the plan title and rerun the command
```

2. **Check if file already exists** at `<repo-root>/<derived-filename>`:

```
❌ Error: Plan file already exists

Details: File exists at: <repo-root>/<derived-filename>

Suggested action:
  1. Change plan title to generate different filename
  2. Or delete existing: rm <repo-root>/<derived-filename>
  3. Or choose different plan name
```

**Save the plan:**

Use the Write tool to save:

- Path: `<repo-root>/<derived-filename>`
- Content: Full enhanced plan markdown content
- Verify file creation

**If save fails:**

```
❌ Error: Failed to save plan file

Details: [specific write error from tool]

Suggested action:
  1. Check file permissions in repository root
  2. Verify available disk space
  3. Ensure path is valid: <repo-root>/<derived-filename>
```

**Output success message:**

```markdown
✅ Plan saved: <repo-root>/<derived-filename>

You can now:

1. Review and edit the plan file if needed
2. Create the worktree: /create-planned-stack

---

{"plan_file": "<repo-root>/<derived-filename>", "status": "created"}
```

## Important Notes

- 🔴 **This command does NOT create worktrees** - only saves enhanced plan
- Searches conversation for implementation plans
- Enhances plans through clarifying questions when helpful
- Suggests phase decomposition for complex plans with multiple features
- All enhancements are optional - users can dismiss suggestions
- Filename derived from plan title, prompts user if extraction fails
- All errors follow consistent template with details and suggested actions
- User can edit the plan file after creation before creating worktree
- Always provide clear feedback at each step
