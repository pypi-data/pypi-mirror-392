# unimath — Mathematical Environment Library in Python

  

**unimath** is a Python library that provides an abstract mathematical environment designed to represent and manipulate sets, intervals, and number systems in a symbolic and intuitive way.

The project is continuously growing, with new mathematical structures and operations being added every day.

  

Developed and maintained by a **Mathematics undergraduate student at Marmara University**, unimath aims to combine mathematical theory with computational representation, creating a bridge between abstract reasoning and code implementation.

## Visualization

  

unimath includes built-in vector visualization features using **matplotlib**, allowing users to plot and analyze vector relationships directly in Python. This helps bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and geometric intuition.

## Installation / Download

  

### PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install unimath
```
### Git 

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/Jolankaa/unimath
cd unimath
pip install .
```

###  Few Examples
```bash
import unimath
# Example: Creating a vector

v = unimath.Vector([1,2,3])

print("Magnitude:", v.magnitude())
# For visualization
v.Visualization()

# Example: Creating a matrix

m = unimath.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
print("Determinant:", m.determinant())
```
