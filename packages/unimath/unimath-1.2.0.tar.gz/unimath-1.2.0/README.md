# unimath —  Mathematical Environment Library in Python

**unimath** is a Python library that provides an abstract mathematical environment designed to represent and manipulate sets, intervals, and number systems in a symbolic and intuitive way.  
The project is continuously growing, with new mathematical structures and operations being added every day.

Developed and maintained by a **Mathematics undergraduate student at Marmara University**, unimath aims to combine mathematical theory with computational representation, creating a bridge between abstract reasoning and code implementation.
