# unimath —  Mathematical Environment Library in Python

**unimath** is a Python library that provides an abstract mathematical environment designed to represent and manipulate sets, intervals, and number systems in a symbolic and intuitive way.  
The project is continuously growing, with new mathematical structures and operations being added every day.

Developed and maintained by a **Mathematics undergraduate student at Marmara University**, unimath aims to combine mathematical theory with computational representation, creating a bridge between abstract reasoning and code implementation.

##  Features

- Abstract representation of **Sets**, **Intervals**, and **Number Systems**  
- Support for **Vector operations** and **linear algebra concepts**  
- Symbolic and numerical computation environment  
- Integration with **matplotlib** for visualization  
- Intuitive class structures and error handling for mathematical rigor

---

##  Vector 

- Magnitude  
- Specific vector information  
- Inner product  
- Angle between two vectors  
- Visualization with matplotlib  
- Find unit vector  
- Cosine value between two vectors  
- Projection around two vectors  

---

##  Matrix

- Precisely defined mathematically 
- Transpose  
- Special matrix definitions 
- Determinant
- Hadamard and classical product

---

## Combinatorics 

- Permutation  
- Combination  
- Posibilty 

---

## Calculus

- Find Supremum İnfrimum value 
- Σ and Π operations  
- Transformation
- Monotonicity of the series  

---

##  Visualization

unimath includes built-in vector visualization features using **matplotlib**, allowing users to plot and analyze vector relationships directly in Python. This helps bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and geometric intuition.
