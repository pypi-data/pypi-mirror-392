# Zalo Integration SDK

This is a work in progress project. **Use at your own risk!**

At this point, this library only support Official Account APIs.

If you found any problems, please create an issue to track it, or feel free to open a PR.

## Documentation

The code is its own document.

(I'm kidding, I'll add documentation later)
