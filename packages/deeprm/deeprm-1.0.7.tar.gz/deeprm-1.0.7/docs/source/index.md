## ✨ Introduction
DeepRM is a deep learning-based framework for RNA modification detection using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing.
This repository contains the source code for training and running DeepRM.

## 🎯 Key Features
* **High accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in RNA modification detection and stoichiometry measurement.
* **Single-molecule resolution**: Provides single-molecule level predictions for RNA modifications.
* **End-to-end pipeline**: Easy-to-use, 2-step workflow from raw reads to site-level & molecule-level predictions.
* **Customizable**: Supports training of custom models.
