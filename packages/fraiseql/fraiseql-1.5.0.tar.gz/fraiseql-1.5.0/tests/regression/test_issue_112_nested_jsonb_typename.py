"""Regression test for Issue #112: Nested JSONB Resolution Returns Wrong __typename and Missing Fields.

This test reproduces the bug where nested JSONB objects return with:
1. Wrong `__typename` - Returns parent type instead of actual nested type
2. Missing fields - Nested object missing fields defined in GraphQL schema
