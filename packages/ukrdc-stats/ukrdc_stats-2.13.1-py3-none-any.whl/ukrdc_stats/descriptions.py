        # All Patients Undergoing Kidney Replacement Therapy

        ## Overview
        This pie chart illustrates the proportion of patients who received kidney replacement therapy within the time period. The chart is broken down by the type of treatment, including HD In-center, HD Home, HD Unknown/Incomplete, PD, and Tx. Optionally the chart can be filtered by satellite unit. 

        ## Treatment Definitions
        - HD: Haemodialysis patients (with a modality defined as HD by the UKRDC). This includes patients registered for haemodialysis, haemofiltration, haemodiafiltration, or ultrafiltration. 
        - PD: Peritoneal dialysis (with a modality defined as PD by the UKRDC).This includes patients registered for CAPD or APD treatments.
        - TX: Transplant patients (with a modality defined as TX), including both living and cadaver donors.
        - In-centre: HD patients with qbl05 field of the Treatment table as HOSP or SATL.   
        - Home: HD patients with qbl05 field of the Treatment table as HOME. 
        - Unknown/Incomplete: HD patients with incomplete qbl05 field or anything other than HOME, HOSP, or SATL

        ## Methodology 
        - Any patients with a time of death before the beginning of the time window were excluded from the cohort, as were any patients whose treatments started before and ended after it.
        - Patient's therapy types was selected using the admission reason and the unit, and were further split into home and in-center therapy groups (with all patients on PD included in the home therapies group).
        - The numbers were calculated from aggregating patients within the five groups: HD Home, HD In-centre, HD Unknown/Incomplete, PD and TX.
        - No deduplication is applied to the treatment records so patients with multiple treatments will be double counted

        ## Overview
        This histogram represents the mean number of dialysis sessions per week for all dialysis patients in a three month period at a sendingfacility or one of its satellites. Optionally the chart can be filtered by satellite unit. 

        ## Methodology
        - Dialysis sessions are counted for patients in the 'All Patients Undergoing Kidney Replacement Therapy' cohort. This is done by grouping on the procedure type code. 
        - Patients with less than two sessions are rejected. 
        - The per week frequency is calculated for each person by dividing the count by the time difference between their first and last dialysis session within the three month period.
        - Patients are aggregated into bins of with boundaries (0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 7.0). This are labelled 1,2,3 and >3 sessions per week.  

        ## UKRDC Entities Used
        The dialysis sessions table is queried by grouping by ukrdcid with the following aggregate functions used:
