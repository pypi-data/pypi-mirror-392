## Typing stubs for pycountry

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`pycountry`](https://github.com/pycountry/pycountry) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `pycountry`. This version of
`types-pycountry` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pycountry==24.6.*`.

*Note:* The `pycountry` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 23.12.11. Please uninstall the `types-pycountry`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
