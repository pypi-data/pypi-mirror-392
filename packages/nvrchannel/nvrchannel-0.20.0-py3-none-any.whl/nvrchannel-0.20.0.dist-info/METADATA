# NVRChannel
Network video recorder for iot_devices compatible apps.
Requires GStreamer to be installed on the system.

Split into a separate lib due to the large model file.


## Changes

### 0.2.0

Due to changes in the AI world and availability of hardware vision acceleration,
along with things like 3D radars for interactive applications, I do not
consider the AI and multiregion features in the previous version all that relevant, and the level of complexity is more than I have time to maintain
while also pursuing other projects.

* Remove AI features
* Remove motion detection regions
* BREAKING: Config keys renamed
* Compatibility with new iot_devices API

### 0.1.7 
* setup.py file include fix

### 0.1.6

* Use cv2.dnn because tflite keeps breaking on python version updates.
* Switch to MobileNetSSD
