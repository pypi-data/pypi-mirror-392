## Overview

StanLogic is a Python package dedicated to Boolean expression simplification and logical reasoning. It provides computational tools that bridge mathematical formalism and algorithmic implementation for digital logic, electronics, and computer science education.

The project aims to serve as a pedagogical and research tool, offering students, educators, and developers a clear computational framework for analyzing and minimizing Boolean logic.

## Research Background

StanLogic is part of an ongoing research initiative by ```Stan's Technologies```, focused on computational models in logic, electronics, and algorithm design. The motivation behind this work is to create open-source computational models that can aid teaching, research, and local problem-solving in Africa and beyond.

This project demonstrates how algorithmic engineering can make mathematical and electronic concepts tangible through simulation and software. The goal is to advance computational literacy by showing how complex logic principles can be represented in executable form.

## Modules within the Package

1. KMapSolver – A module for deriving minimal SOP (Sum of Products) and POS (Product of Sums) expressions for 2, 3, and 4-variable Karnaugh Maps.

    - Supports don’t-care conditions.

    - Uses efficient bitmask operations for implicant filtering and coverage analysis.

    - Outputs minimal Boolean expressions with human-readable and symbolic formats.

Future modules will include additional logic simplifiers, expression parsers, and symbolic verification tools.

### Documentation and Test Files

- Documentation can be found here: [kmapsolver.md](docs/kmapsolver.md)
- Test files can be found here: [kmapsolver tests](tests/)

The documentation provides extensive guides on the thought processes behind the costruction of the algorithm, key optimizations, and future research directions. 

The test files show how the methods within the algorithm may be used, as well as benchmark test cases against ```SymPy```, and the corresponding output
