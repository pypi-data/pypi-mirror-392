**Build production software alone with team-level sophistication.**

> Structured Solo Development with AI and Quality Automation for Claude Code

## What is Solokit?

**Solokit is a complete development framework for solo developers building production software with AI assistants like Claude Code.** It combines production-ready project templates, automated quality gates, intelligent session management, and AI-powered knowledge capture into a cohesive workflow that enables you to build alone with the sophistication of a 10-person engineering team.

### The Core Problem

Solo developers using AI assistants face critical challenges:
- **Setup Time Waste** - Spending hours configuring frameworks, linters, tests, CI/CD
- **Context Loss** - AI forgets previous work between sessions
- **Quality Entropy** - Standards slip without enforcement
- **Knowledge Fragmentation** - Learnings and decisions get lost
- **Lack of Process** - No systematic workflow for complex projects

### The Solokit Solution

**🚀 Production-Ready in <1 Minute**
- 4 validated project templates (T3 Stack, FastAPI, Refine, Next.js)
- 4 quality tiers (Essential → Production-Ready)
- All dependencies version-pinned and compatibility-tested
- CI/CD, Docker, environment templates included

**✨ Perfect Context Continuity**
- Comprehensive AI briefings restore full project state
- Spec-first architecture with complete implementation details
- Previous work context for multi-session features
- Dependency-aware workflow recommendations

**🛡️ Zero-Compromise Quality**
- Automated gates: tests, linting, formatting, security
- Coverage thresholds, mutation testing, E2E tests
- Performance monitoring, error tracking (tier 4)
- Spec validation before and after sessions

**🧠 Knowledge That Grows**
- AI-powered learning categorization (6 categories)
- Automatic extraction from commits and code comments
- Smart deduplication and similarity detection
- Searchable, filterable knowledge base

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Solokit

```bash
# macOS/Linux
pip3 install solokit

# Windows
py -m pip install solokit
```

> **First-time macOS users:** When you run `pip3` for the first time, macOS will prompt you to install Command Line Tools. This is normal and required - the installation takes 5-10 minutes.

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
sk init
```

Choose from **4 production-ready stacks**:
- **SaaS T3 Stack** - Next.js + tRPC + Prisma (full-stack SaaS)
- **ML/AI FastAPI** - FastAPI + Python ML libraries (model serving, data pipelines)
- **Dashboard Refine** - Refine + shadcn/ui (admin panels, internal tools)
- **Full-Stack Next.js** - Next.js + Prisma (general purpose web apps)

Select your **quality tier**:
- **Essential** (60-80% coverage) - Prototypes, MVPs
- **Standard** (80% coverage + security) - Production apps
- **Comprehensive** (90% coverage + E2E + mutation) - Mission-critical
- **Production-Ready** (+ monitoring + observability) - Enterprise-grade

Options: CI/CD workflows, Docker support, environment templates

### 3. Start Building

```bash
# Create your first work item
sk work-new

# Start a development session
sk start

# Claude receives a comprehensive briefing with:
# - Complete work item specification
# - Project documentation and context
# - Technology stack and file structure
# - Related learnings from past sessions
# - Dependency information

# Work with Claude...

# End session with automated quality gates
sk end
```

**That's it!** You now have:
- ✅ Production-ready project setup
- ✅ Automated quality enforcement
- ✅ Perfect AI context continuity
- ✅ Growing knowledge base

## 💡 Best Used with Claude Code

Solokit is designed to work seamlessly with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), providing:

- **Slash Command Interface**: Use `/start`, `/end`, `/work-new`, and more without memorizing CLI syntax
- **Context Continuity**: Claude maintains full project context across sessions, understanding your work items, dependencies, and progress
- **Interactive Workflow**: Rich prompts and guided workflows make session management effortless
- **Quality Automation**: Automatic quality gate validation and learning capture integrated into your natural workflow

### Quick Start with Claude Code

1. **Initialize your project** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   sk init
   ```

2. **Open in Claude Code** and use slash commands:
   ```
   /work-new      # Create your first work item
   /start         # Begin a development session with full briefing
   /end           # Complete session with quality gates
   ```

That's it! Claude Code handles the rest, providing context-aware assistance throughout your development session.

sk end                # Complete session
```

</details>

### 🎯 Work Item Management

**Dependency-driven, spec-first workflow:**

> 💡 **Recommended: Use Claude Code for interactive work item creation and management**

**Create and manage work items** in Claude Code:

```
/work-new                              # Create work items interactively
/work-list                             # List all work items
/work-list --status not_started        # Filter by status
/work-list --milestone "v1.0"          # Filter by milestone

/work-next                             # Get smart recommendations (dependencies completed)

/work-graph --critical-path            # Show longest dependency chain
/work-graph --bottlenecks              # Identify blockers
/work-graph --format svg               # Export visual graph

/work-update feature_xyz --status in_progress
/work-update feature_xyz --priority high
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Terminal Usage</strong> (without AI assistance)</summary>

```bash
sk work-new                        # Create work items interactively
sk work-list                       # List all work items
sk work-list --status not_started
sk work-list --milestone "v1.0"

sk work-next                       # Get recommendations
sk work-graph --critical-path      # Visualize dependencies
sk work-update feature_xyz --status in_progress
```

</details>

**Spec-First Architecture:**

Work item specifications are the single source of truth:

```
.session/
├── specs/
│   ├── feature_xyz.md         # Complete implementation guide
│   └── deployment_abc.md
└── tracking/
    └── work_items.json         # Metadata only (status, deps)
```

**6 work item types** with structured templates:
- **Feature** - New functionality
- **Bug** - Issue fixes with root cause analysis
- **Refactor** - Code improvements
- **Security** - Security enhancements
- **Integration Test** - Test suites
- **Deployment** - Deployment procedures

Each template includes:
- Required sections enforced via validation
- Implementation details, acceptance criteria
- Testing strategy, validation rules
- Type-specific guidelines

### 🧠 Learning System

**AI-powered knowledge capture and curation:**

> 💡 **Recommended: Use Claude Code for AI-assisted learning capture**

**Capture and browse learnings** in Claude Code:

```
/learn                                # Capture learnings during development (AI-assisted)

/learn-show                           # Browse all learnings
/learn-show --category gotchas --tag fastapi

/learn-search "CORS"                  # Search by keyword

/learn-curate                         # Auto-curate (categorize, deduplicate, merge)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Terminal Usage</strong> (without AI assistance)</summary>

```bash
sk learn                       # Capture learnings manually
sk learn-show                  # Browse all learnings
sk learn-search "CORS"         # Search by keyword
sk learn-curate                # Run curation
```

</details>

**6 Learning Categories** (auto-categorized):
- **Architecture** - Design decisions, patterns
- **Gotchas** - Edge cases, pitfalls
- **Best Practices** - Effective approaches
- **Technical Debt** - Areas needing improvement
- **Performance** - Optimization insights
- **Security** - Security discoveries

**3 Extraction Sources:**
1. Session summaries ("Learnings Captured" section)
2. Git commits (`LEARNING:` annotations)
3. Code comments (`# LEARNING:` in changed files)

**Smart Deduplication:**
- Jaccard + containment similarity detection
- Automatic merging of similar learnings
- Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.7)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Required:**
- **Python 3.9+** - Core runtime
- **pip/pip3** - Package installer (see OS-specific notes below)
- **Git** - Version control
- **Claude Code** - *Strongly recommended* for slash command integration and optimal workflow experience. While Solokit can be used via CLI alone, Claude Code provides the richest experience with interactive prompts, context continuity, and intelligent assistance.

**OS-Specific Requirements:**

**macOS:**
- Use `pip3` instead of `pip` on fresh installations
- **Command Line Tools** - macOS will prompt you to install these automatically when you first run `pip3` (5-10 minute installation, completely normal)
- **PATH Setup** - You may need to add the install location to your PATH (see Troubleshooting below)

**Windows:**
- Use `py -m pip` instead of `pip` for reliable installation
- Ensure Python is added to PATH during Python installation

**Linux:**
- Use `pip3` for Python 3.x installations
- May need to install `python3-pip` package first: `sudo apt install python3-pip` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo dnf install python3-pip` (Fedora/RHEL)

**Optional Tools** (for quality gates):
- Testing: `pytest` (Python), `jest` (JS/TS)
- Linting: `ruff` (Python), `eslint` (JS/TS)
- Formatting: `prettier` (JS/TS)
- Security: `bandit`, `safety` (Python), `npm audit` (JS)
- Visualization: `graphviz` (dependency graphs)

Quality gates gracefully skip when tools aren't available.

### Option 1: PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
pip3 install solokit

# Windows
py -m pip install solokit
```

**Post-Installation (macOS):**

If you see a warning that `sk` is not on PATH, add it to your shell configuration:

```bash
# For zsh (default on modern macOS)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

> **Note:** Adjust the Python version (3.9) to match your installed version if different.

### Option 2: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankushdixit/solokit.git
cd solokit

# macOS/Linux
pip3 install -e .

# Windows
py -m pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
sk status
```

If `sk` command is not found, see the Troubleshooting section below.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

#### "command not found: sk"

**macOS/Linux:**
The `sk` command is installed in your Python user bin directory, which may not be on your PATH.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find where sk is installed
pip3 show solokit

# Add to PATH (example for macOS with zsh)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify
sk status
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Add Python Scripts to PATH
# Go to System Properties > Environment Variables
# Add: C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts
```

#### "command not found: pip" (macOS)

**Problem:** Fresh macOS installations only have `pip3`, not `pip`.

**Solution:** Use `pip3` instead:
```bash
pip3 install solokit
```

#### "xcode-select: note: No developer tools were found"

**This is normal on fresh macOS!** When you run `pip3` for the first time, macOS needs to install Command Line Tools.

**Solution:**
- Click "Install" when prompted
- Wait 5-10 minutes for the installation to complete
- Then retry: `pip3 install solokit`

#### "WARNING: You are using pip version X.X.X"

**This warning is safe to ignore.** Solokit works with older pip versions. If you want to update pip:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
pip3 install --upgrade pip

# Windows
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Python Version Issues

**Problem:** Solokit requires Python 3.9 or higher.

**Check your Python version:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

**Solution:** If you have an older version, install Python 3.9+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Permission Errors on Linux

**Problem:** `Permission denied` when installing packages.

**Solution:** Use `--user` flag to install in your user directory:
```bash
pip3 install --user solokit
```

Or use a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install solokit
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check existing issues:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ankushdixit/solokit/issues)
2. **Run diagnostics:** `sk doctor` (after installation)
3. **Open a new issue:** Include:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version (`python3 --version`)
   - Error message (full output)
   - Steps to reproduce
