# sphinx-tojupyter

A [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) Extension for
Generating [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

## Installation

To install you can clone the repository and install using:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Update project `conf.py` file to include the jupyter extension and the
desired **configuration** settings (see [configuration](#configuration)
section below):

``` {.python}
extensions = ["sphinx_tojupyter"]
```

then run

```bash
make jupyter
```

## Features

### MyST-NB Glue Support

This extension supports [MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) glue functionality, allowing you to store and reference notebook variables in your documentation:

**Basic Usage:**

```markdown
\```python
from myst_nb import glue
glue("my_variable", "Hello World")
glue("my_number", 3.14159)
\```

The value is {glue:text}`my_variable` and pi is approximately {glue:text}`my_number:.2f`.
```

**Figure Glue:**

```markdown
\```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from myst_nb import glue

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
glue("my_plot", fig, display=False)
\```

\```{glue:figure} my_plot
:name: fig-example

Caption for the figure.
\```
```

**Requirements:**
- Add `myst_nb` to your extensions in `conf.py`
- Set `nb_execution_mode = "cache"` (or "auto"/"force")

See the [test suite](tests/glue/) for more examples.

### sphinx-proof Support

Full support for [sphinx-proof](https://sphinx-proof.readthedocs.io/) directives, allowing you to include mathematical theorems, proofs, and related content in your notebooks:

**Supported Directives (15 types):**
- `theorem`, `axiom`, `lemma`, `definition`, `remark`
- `conjecture`, `corollary`, `algorithm`, `criterion`
- `example`, `property`, `observation`, `proposition`
- `assumption`, `notation`, `proof`

**Example:**

```markdown
\```{prf:theorem} Pythagorean Theorem
:label: pythagoras

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
\```

\```{prf:proof}
The proof follows from...
\```
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic numbering from Sphinx's numfig system
- ✅ Support for titled and untitled directives
- ✅ Cross-reference handling
- ✅ Clean markdown formatting for notebooks

**Requirements:**
- Add `sphinx_proof` to your extensions in `conf.py`
- Enable `numfig = True` for numbered directives

See the [test suite](tests/sphinx_proof/) for comprehensive examples.

### LaTeX Macros Support

Define custom LaTeX commands once, use everywhere (HTML and notebooks):

```python
# conf.py
mathjax3_config = {
    'tex': {
        'macros': {
            'ZZ': r'\mathbb{Z}',
            'RR': r'\mathbb{R}',
            'NN': r'\mathbb{N}',
        }
    }
}
```

Then use them in your documentation:

```markdown
The set of integers is $\ZZ$ and the reals are $\RR$.
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single configuration for HTML and notebooks
- ✅ Standard Sphinx/Jupyter Book approach  
- ✅ Macros automatically added to generated notebooks
- ✅ Works with existing `mathjax3_config` setups

See the [LaTeX macros documentation](docs/latex-macros.md) and [test suite](tests/latex_macros/) for more details.
