A plugin to include applications under development by and useful utility scripts for the architecture team at 2U.

Overview
********

This plugin is meant to house experimental and in-development applications from the edX architecture team at 2U that are either not appropriate (i.e. 2U-specific) or not yet ready for community consumption.
It also includes some one-off scripts meant to reduce toil for the team.

Development Workflow
********************

One Time Setup
==============
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:edx/edx-arch-experiments.git
  cd edx-arch-experiments

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.11 edx-arch-experiments

Local testing
=============
Two options are available for testing changes locally:

First, via `make test-shell` a dockerized development envrionment can be launched to run `pytest` and do basic migration work.

Second, a local copy of the package can be installed into edx-platform. For example, if using devstack, copy or clone your branch into <devstack-parent>/src/edx-arch-experiments. Then, in an lms or cms shell, run ``pip install -e /edx/src/edx-arch-experiments``.  The plug-in configuration will automatically be picked up once installed, and changes will be hot reloaded.


Every time you develop something in this repo
=============================================
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon edx-arch-experiments

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim …

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit …
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.
