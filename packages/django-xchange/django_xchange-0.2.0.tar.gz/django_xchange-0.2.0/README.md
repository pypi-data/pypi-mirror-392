Django XChange is a library providing a Rate model containing currency exchange rates for a day.

It relies on third-party libraries to fetch historical exchange rates.

How to use
----------

Default configuration is defined at src/django_xchange/config.py::DEFAULT_SETTINGS

A Django settings DJANGO_XCHANGE dictionary must be configured to override the default settings.

It is mandatory to configure the DJANGO_XCHANGE['BROKERS'] item with a list of brokers you intend to use.

For example:

```python
DJANGO_XCHANGE = {
    'BROKERS': ['django_xchange.brokers.pyoxr.PyoxrBroker']
}
```

See specific notes for the third-party exchange providers configuration
