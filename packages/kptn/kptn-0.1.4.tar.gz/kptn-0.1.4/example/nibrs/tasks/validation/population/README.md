# NIBRS Estimation Pipeline

## Running population validation scripts outside of Docker --- CURRENTLY DEFUNCT

No additional environment variables are needed to run the population validations scripts outside of Docker. Once the environment variables from the main README have been defined and the working directory is set to `./nibrs-estimation-pipeline/tasks/validation/population`, all that is required is running `100_Run_Pop_Validation.R`.
