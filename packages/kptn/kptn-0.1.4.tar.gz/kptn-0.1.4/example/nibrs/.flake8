# Ignore some warnings/errors. flake8 ignores some warnings/errors by default.
# However, we don't want to ignore the same ones ignored by default. Therefore,
# we define this using `ignore` instead of `extends-ignore`.
ignore =
    # Whitespace before ':'
    #   This is for black compatibility, because there are some instances where
    #   black intentionally adds a space before a ':' in slices.
    E203,

    # Line too long
    #   Black will enforce line-length restrictions, so no need to check for it
    #   here.
    E501,

    # Line break before binary operator
    #   This is for black compatibility, because black breaks lines before a
    #   binary operator. Breaking lines after a binary operator is reported as
    #   W504, which is mutually exclusive with W503.
    W503,

    # Missing docstrings
    #   The D1xx errors are provided by flake8-docstrings. We will use our
    #   discretion about where to require docstrings. For example, we won't
    #   bother adding them to the Django auto-generated/boilerplate code.
