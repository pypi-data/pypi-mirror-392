# NIBRS Estimation Pipeline

## Running outlier detection scripts outside of Docker

No additional environment variables are needed to run the outlier detection scripts outside of Docker. Once the environment variables from the main README have been defined and the working directory is set to `./nibrs-estimation-pipeline/tasks/detect_outliers`, all that is required is running `100_run_outlier_detection_scripts.R`.
