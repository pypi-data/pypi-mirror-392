    "**Summary of Report Finding**<br>\n",
    "The goal of this report is to highlight agency reporting differences between the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) database and Summary Reporting System (SRS) datasets. For example, when an agency is actively reporting to SRS, but is missing from the NIBRS, it may negatively impact estimates that rely on the NIBRS data. In particular, we want to draw attention to discrepancies at large agencies (>100,000 population or >750 officers), which have larger impacts on estimates."
