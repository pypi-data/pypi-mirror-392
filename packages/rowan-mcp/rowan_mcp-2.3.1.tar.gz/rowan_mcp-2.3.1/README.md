# Rowan MCP Server

MCP server for making it easy to run Rowan's molecular design and simulation tools.

---

## **Installation**

### **Option 1: Auto-Install (No manual installation needed!)**

Just add this to your MCP configuration and it will automatically install and run:

**HTTP/SSE configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rowan": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:6276/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Then start the server:
```bash
# Set your API key
export ROWAN_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Start the HTTP server
uvx --from rowan-mcp rowan-mcp
```

### **Option 2: Manual Installation**

If you prefer to install the package first:

**Using uv:**
```bash
uv add rowan-mcp
```

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install rowan-mcp
```

Then configure and start:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rowan": {
      "type": "http", 
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:6276/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Set API key and start server
export ROWAN_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
rowan-mcp
```

### **Get API Key**

Visit [labs.rowansci.com](https://labs.rowansci.com) → Create account → Generate API key

### **Start Using**

Ask your AI: *"Calculate the pKa of aspirin"* or *"Optimize the geometry of caffeine"*

---

## **What You Can Do** 

Ask the LLM to:
- **Calculate drug properties**: *"Predict drug-likeness of aspirin"*
- **Optimize molecular structures**: *"Optimize the geometry of aspirin"* 
- **Predict chemical behavior**: *"What's the pKa of acetic acid?"*
- **Run calculations**: *"Calculate the HOMO and LUMO of benzene"*

## **System Requirements**

- **Python 3.11+** 
- **Package manager**: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- **Rowan API key** (free at [labs.rowansci.com](https://labs.rowansci.com))
- **MCP-compatible client** (Claude Desktop, etc.)

**Development commands** (if you cloned the repo):
```bash
# Run from source
export ROWAN_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
uv run python -m rowan_mcp
```

## **Experimental: Desktop Extension (Work in Progress)**

Working on a one-click desktop extension (.dxt) for Claude Desktop that eliminates command-line setup! This feature is currently being refined for compatibility with the MCP extension system.

For now, use the standard Package Installation method above, which is fully tested and reliable.
