    WARNING: This function blocks and can cause MCP timeouts! Workflow duration varies 
    widely - simple calculations finish in seconds, complex workflows (conformer searches, 
    large proteins, docking) can take 10-30 minutes. Consider using workflow_get_status 
    with adaptive polling instead.
    
    Essential for chaining dependent workflows where subsequent calculations 
    require results from previous ones. Blocks execution until the workflow 
    completes, then returns the full results.
    
    IMPORTANT: This function waits until the workflow is "finished" but that 
    includes FAILED workflows. Always check "is_successful" and "is_failed" 
    flags in the response to determine if the workflow actually succeeded.
    
    Common use cases:
    - Conformer search → Redox potential for each conformer
    - Optimization → Frequency calculation on optimized geometry
    - Multiple sequential optimizations with different methods
    - Any workflow chain where results feed into next calculation
    
    Example workflow chain:
        1. Submit conformer search
        2. Wait for conformer search to complete (using this function)
        3. Check if is_successful=True before proceeding
        4. Extract conformer geometries from results
