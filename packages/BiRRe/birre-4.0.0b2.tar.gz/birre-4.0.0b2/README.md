**BiRRe** (*Bi*tsight *R*ating *Re*triever) is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
that provides access to BitSight security rating data through an existing subscription.
It utilizes [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/) for API integration
and can be run easily without installation in a temporary, isolated Python environment with uv.

## Installation

### Quick start

- Set your BitSight API key, then start BiRRe:

```bash
export BITSIGHT_API_KEY="your-bitsight-api-key"
uvx --from git+https://github.com/boecht/birre birre run
```

- Point your LLM of choice to the MCP server and ask it for the BitSight rating of any company.
- Explore the CLI with the added `--help` flag or consult [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).
  Individual subcommands such as `run` and `selftest` also provide dedicated `--help` output.

### Configuration

Configuration sources (lowest → highest): `config.toml` → `config.local.toml` → environment → CLI.
See the descriptions in `config.toml` for available fields and details. For CLI options,
run with `--help` or consult [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md).

### Run directly from GitHub with uvx

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/boecht/birre birre run
```

### Or run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boecht/birre
uv run birre run
```

That's it! The script will automatically install all dependencies using uv.

## Features

### Available Tools

BiRRe supports context-specific toolsets:

- **`standard` context (default)** – quick rating workflows
  - `company_search`: Search BitSight for companies by name or domain
  - `get_company_rating`: Retrieve security ratings with automatic subscription management
- **`risk_manager` context** – subscription and onboarding operations
  - `company_search_interactive`: Enriched search results (name + GUID, domains, description,
  employee count, subscription folders) for human-in-the-loop selection
  - `manage_subscriptions`: Bulk subscribe/unsubscribe GUIDs with dry-run support and audit summaries
  - `request_company`: Submit BitSight company requests
  (deduplicates existing requests, attempts v2 bulk workflow with folder targeting, falls back gracefully)
  - regular `company_search` and `get_company_rating` remain available for spot checks

Select a context via `--context`, `BIRRE_CONTEXT`, or the `[runtime].context` config key.

## BitSight API Documentation (v1 + v2 are complementary)

**API Version**: This implementation is based on BitSight APIs as of July 24th, 2025.
  For the latest API changes and updates, refer to
  the [BitSight API Change Log](https://help.bitsighttech.com/hc/en-us/articles/231655907-API-Change-Log).

**Interactive API Documentation** (requires BitSight account login):

- **v1 API**: <https://service.bitsighttech.com/customer-api/v1/ui> (383 endpoints)
- **v2 API**: <https://service.bitsighttech.com/customer-api/v2/ui> (20 enhanced features)

**Schema Updates**: To update API schemas when forking or contributing:

1. Log into BitSight web interface
2. Download schemas from:
    - **v1**: <https://service.bitsighttech.com/customer-api/ratings/v1/schema>
    - **v2**: <https://service.bitsighttech.com/customer-api/ratings/v2/schema>
3. Save as `src/birre/resources/apis/bitsight.v1.schema.json`
    and `src/birre/resources/apis/bitsight.v2.schema.json`

## Version History and Outlook

### Version 1.0: MVP

- **Company Search**: Search for companies by name or domain via API v1 `companySearch`
- **Company Rating**: Retrieve core rating details with automatic subscription management
- **Ephemeral Subscriptions**: Subscribe/unsubscribe on demand to avoid license leakage
- **Structured Error Handling**: Clear responses for quota/subscription failures
- **uv/uvx Compatible**: Run easily with uv using PEP 723 inline script metadata

### Version 2.0: Top Vulnerability Insights

- **Top Findings Summary**: Attach the most impactful vulnerabilities to the rating payload,
using relaxed severity filters (severe/material first, then moderate with web-appsec padding when needed)
- **Enhanced Sorting**: Prioritise findings by severity, asset importance,
and recency to keep the worst issues on top
- **Narrative Improvements**: Normalise detection/remediation text for quick consumption by MCP clients

### Version 3.0: Context Modes (Latest Stable)

- Two personas: `standard` (quick ratings) and `risk_manager` (subscription operations)
- Context-driven tool filtering via CLI (`--context`), env (`BIRRE_CONTEXT`), or config
- Risk manager tooling delivers enriched search data, dry-run batch subscription workflows,
and company onboarding requests without in-tool prompts (LLMs coordinate user confirmations)

### Version 4.0: Structural Hardening & Developer Ergonomics (Planned)

- Treat strict typing, property-based tests, and benchmarks as ship gates
- Keep cross-platform CI + telemetry visible for regression detection
- Harden release workflows (Sigstore signing, SBOMs, dependency review, branch protection)
- Finish CLI/diagnostics refinements and contributor-focused documentation

### Version 5.0: Caching & Company Reports (Planned)

- Daily caching of ratings and reusable storage for BitSight artefacts
- Stop redundant API calls and reuse cached assets when exporting reports
- Deliver official PDF reports via direct response, email, or configured file share

### Version 6.0: Multi-Tenant Service (Planned)

- Remote deployment support
- Authentication and authorization
- Concurrent user support

## Testing

### CLI Commands Overview

BiRRe provides a modular CLI with the following command groups:

- **`run`** - Start the MCP server with optional startup checks and context selection
- **`config`** - Initialize, show, or validate configuration files and settings
- **`logs`** - Inspect and maintain log files (clear, rotate, show, path)
- **`selftest`** - Run comprehensive diagnostics against BitSight APIs

All commands support `--help` for detailed usage. See [docs/CLI.md](docs/CLI.md) for complete CLI reference.

### Review configuration state

Use the `config` command group to review or validate the effective settings before
you run diagnostics or bring up the server. It surfaces the values assembled from
`config.toml`, `config.local.toml`, environment variables, and CLI overrides,
and can also sanity-check standalone configuration files.

```bash
# Inspect configuration sources and resolved settings.
uv run birre config show

# Validate (and optionally minimize) a configuration file before use.
uv run birre config validate --config my.config.toml --minimize
```

### Selftest

Use the built-in self test to sanity-check your setup before connecting a
client. The command mirrors the `run` startup sequence, reports the resolved
configuration, and exercises BitSight connectivity, subscription, and tooling
checks against BitSight’s testing environment (staging). When invoked with
`--offline`, only the local configuration and logging checks run.

```bash
# Run the full diagnostics against the default BitSight testing endpoint.
uv run birre selftest

# Target the production API to exercise real subscription logic and permissions.
uv run birre selftest --production
```

Successful runs exit with `0`. Failures return `1`, and partial results with
warnings (for example, optional tooling gaps in offline mode) return `2`.
Expect occasional `403 Access Denied` responses when using BitSight’s testing
environment.

### Testing with pytest

BiRRe ships with both offline unit tests and online integration checks.

- Recommended: run the full suite; online tests skip automatically if the API key/config is missing.

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest
```

- Only offline (no network):

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest --offline
```

- Only online (requires `BITSIGHT_API_KEY` or local config):

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest --online-only
```
