# EdgeFirst Perception Schemas

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-1.70%2B-orange.svg)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

**Core message schemas and language bindings for the EdgeFirst Perception middleware**

EdgeFirst Perception Schemas provides the foundational message types used throughout the [EdgeFirst Perception](https://doc.edgefirst.ai/latest/perception/) middleware stack. It delivers high-performance Rust and Python bindings for consuming and producing messages in EdgeFirst Perception applications. The library implements [ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) Common Interfaces, [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) schemas, and custom EdgeFirst message types with CDR (Common Data Representation) serialization over [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/).

**No ROS2 Required:** EdgeFirst Perception applications work directly on Linux, Windows, and macOS without any ROS2 installation. For systems that do use ROS2, EdgeFirst Perception interoperates seamlessly through the [Zenoh ROS2 DDS Bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-ros2dds).

## Features

- **🔄 ROS2 Common Interfaces** - Full compatibility with standard [ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) message types (`geometry_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`, `std_msgs`, `nav_msgs`)
- **📊 Foxglove Schema Support** - Native visualization with [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/)
- **⚡ Custom EdgeFirst Messages** - Specialized types for edge AI (detection, tracking, DMA buffers, radar)
- **🦀 High-Performance Rust Bindings** - Zero-copy serialization with CDR encoding
- **🐍 Python Bindings** - Efficient point cloud decoding and message handling
- **📡 Zenoh-Based Communication** - Modern pub/sub over [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/) middleware
- **💻 Cross-Platform** - Linux, Windows, and macOS support
- **🚫 ROS2 Optional** - No ROS2 installation required for EdgeFirst Perception applications

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Rust** (via [crates.io](https://crates.io/)):

```bash
cargo add edgefirst-schemas
```

**Python** (via pip, when published):

```bash
pip install edgefirst-schemas
```

For detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, see the [Developer Guide](https://doc.edgefirst.ai/latest/perception/dev/).

### Consuming Messages (Primary Use Case)

Most applications consume messages from EdgeFirst Perception services. Here's how to decode sensor data:

**Python Example - Consuming PointCloud2:**

```python
from edgefirst.schemas import PointCloud2, decode_pcd

# Receive a point cloud message from EdgeFirst Perception
# (via Zenoh subscriber - see samples for complete examples)
points = decode_pcd(point_cloud_msg)

# Access point data
for point in points:
    x, y, z = point.x, point.y, point.z
    # Process point data...
```

**Rust Example - Consuming Detection Results:**

```rust
use edgefirst_schemas::edgefirst_msgs::Detect;
use edgefirst_schemas::sensor_msgs::Image;

fn process_detections(detect_msg: Detect) {
    for bbox in detect_msg.boxes {
        println!("Class: {}, Confidence: {:.2}",
                 bbox.class_id, bbox.confidence);
        // Process detection...
    }
}
```

**Complete working examples:** See the [EdgeFirst Samples](https://github.com/EdgeFirstAI/samples) repository for full subscriber implementations, Zenoh configuration, and integration patterns.

### Producing Messages (Secondary Use Case)

Applications can also produce messages for custom perception pipelines:

**Python Example - Creating Custom Messages:**

```python
from edgefirst.schemas.geometry_msgs import Pose, Point, Quaternion
from edgefirst.schemas.std_msgs import Header

# Create a pose message
pose = Pose(
    position=Point(x=1.0, y=2.0, z=0.5),
    orientation=Quaternion(x=0.0, y=0.0, z=0.0, w=1.0)
)
```

**Rust Example - Building Detection Messages:**

```rust
use edgefirst_schemas::edgefirst_msgs::{Detect, Box as BBox, Track};
use edgefirst_schemas::std_msgs::Header;

fn create_detection() -> Detect {
    Detect {
        header: Header::default(),
        boxes: vec![
            BBox {
                class_id: 1,
                confidence: 0.95,
                x: 100, y: 100, w: 50, h: 50,
                ..Default::default()
            }
        ],
        tracks: vec![],
        model_info: Default::default(),
    }
}
```

**Learn more:** The [Developer Guide](https://doc.edgefirst.ai/latest/perception/dev/) covers serialization, Zenoh publishing, and message lifecycle management.

### Building from Source

**Rust:**

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

**Python:**

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

**ROS2 Debian Package** (for ROS2 integration only):

```bash
cd edgefirst_msgs
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
fakeroot debian/rules build
dpkg -i ../ros-humble-edgefirst-msgs_*.deb
```

For complete build instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Message Schemas

EdgeFirst Perception Schemas combines three sources of message definitions:

### 1. ROS2 Common Interfaces

Standard [ROS2](https://www.ros.org/) message types for broad interoperability:

- **`std_msgs`** - Basic primitive types (Header, String, etc.)
- **`geometry_msgs`** - Spatial messages (Pose, Transform, Twist, etc.)
- **`sensor_msgs`** - Sensor data (PointCloud2, Image, CameraInfo, Imu, NavSatFix, etc.)
- **`nav_msgs`** - Navigation (Odometry, Path)
- **`builtin_interfaces`** - Time and Duration
- **`rosgraph_msgs`** - Clock

Based on [ROS2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) LTS release.

### 2. Foxglove Schemas

Visualization-focused message types from [Foxglove Schemas](https://github.com/foxglove/schemas):

- Scene graph visualization - 3D rendering primitives
- Annotation types - Bounding boxes, markers, text
- Panel-specific messages - Optimized for [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/)

### 3. EdgeFirst Custom Messages

Specialized types for edge AI perception workflows:

- **`Detect`** - Object detection results with bounding boxes and tracks
- **`Box`** - 2D bounding box with confidence and class
- **`Track`** - Object tracking information with unique IDs
- **`DmaBuffer`** - Zero-copy DMA buffer sharing for hardware accelerators
- **`RadarCube`** - Raw radar data cube for processing
- **`RadarInfo`** - Radar sensor calibration and metadata
- **`Model`** - Neural network model metadata
- **`ModelInfo`** - Inference performance instrumentation

## Architecture

For detailed information about message serialization, CDR encoding, Zenoh communication patterns, and system architecture, see the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

Quick overview:
- Messages are serialized using CDR (Common Data Representation)
- Communication happens over [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/) pub/sub middleware
- ROS2 interoperability via [Zenoh ROS2 DDS Bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-ros2dds) when needed
- Zero-copy optimizations for embedded platforms using DMA buffers
