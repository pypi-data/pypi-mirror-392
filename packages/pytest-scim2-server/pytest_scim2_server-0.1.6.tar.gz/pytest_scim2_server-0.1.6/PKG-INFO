SCIM2 server fixture for Pytest

## Installation

```
pip install pytest-scim2-server
```

## Usage

pytest-scim2-server creates a ``scim2_server`` fixture that runs an instance of [scim2-server](https://github.com/python-scim/scim2-server) on a random port, in a dedicated thread.

```python
import requests

def test_scim_foobar(scim2_server):
    res = request.get(f"http://localhost:{scim2_server.port}")
    ...
```

Note that you can use [scim2-client](https://scim2-client.readthedocs.io) to interact with the SCIM server.

```python
import pytest
from httpx import Client
from scim2_client.engines.httpx import SyncSCIMClient


@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def scim_client(scim2_server):
    http_client = Client(base_url=f"http://localhost:{scim2_server.port}")
    scim_client = SyncSCIMClient(http_client)
    scim_client.discover()
    return scim_client


def test_scim2_server(scim_client):
    User = scim_client.get_resource_model("User")
    user = User(user_name="bjensen@example.com")
    response = scim_client.create(user)

    users = scim_client.query(User)
    assert users.resources[0].id == response.id
```
