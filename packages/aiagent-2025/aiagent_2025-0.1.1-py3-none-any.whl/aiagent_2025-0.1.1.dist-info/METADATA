## Distribution

This is the **private development repository**. The tool is distributed via **PyPI (Python Package Index)**.

**PyPI Package**: https://pypi.org/project/aiagent/

**End-user installation** (recommended for users):
```bash
uv tool install aiagent
```

That's it! Just 3 words - no long URLs needed.

### Distribution Model

This project uses **PyPI distribution** to protect source code while enabling public distribution:

- **Private repo** (this one): Contains all source code, development work, and stays 100% private
- **PyPI** (public): Receives only wheel files (compiled bytecode), NEVER source code
- **Optional**: Public docs repo ([aiagent-cli-releases](https://github.com/HossamTabana/aiagent-cli-releases)) for documentation

**Key files:**
- `pyproject.toml`: Package name (`aiagent`) and version (line 3)
- `PYPI_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: One-time PyPI account setup and first upload
- `PYPI_RELEASE_GUIDE.md`: Workflow for releasing new versions to PyPI
- `github_public/`: Optional documentation files for public GitHub repo
  - `README.md`: User-facing documentation
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: Version history

**For releasing new versions**, see [PYPI_RELEASE_GUIDE.md](PYPI_RELEASE_GUIDE.md).

**For initial PyPI setup**, see [PYPI_SETUP_GUIDE.md](PYPI_SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## Installation (Development)

### Using `uvx` (Recommended for one-time use)

```bash
# Run directly without installation
uvx aiagent-cli understand

# Or install from source
uvx --from /path/to/aiagent_claude aiagent understand
```

### Using `uv` (For persistent installation)

```bash
# Install as a tool
uv tool install aiagent-cli

# Or install from source
uv tool install /path/to/aiagent_claude

# Then use it
aiagent understand
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd /path/to/aiagent_claude

# Install dependencies with uv
uv pip install -e .

# Run the CLI
python -m aiagent_cli.main --help
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Operating System**: macOS, Windows, or Linux
- **Databricks Account** with:
  - Personal Access Token (PAT)
  - Workspace with serving endpoints enabled
  - Access to at least one AI model (Advanced Model, Creative Model, or Analytics Model)

## Getting Started

### Two Ways to Use AI Agent CLI

**🎨 Interactive Menu Mode (Recommended for beginners)**

Simply run `aiagent` without any arguments to launch an interactive menu:

```bash
aiagent
```

You'll see a beautiful menu where you can:
- Select commands by number (1-6)
- Configure authentication interactively
- Create a project brief for better analysis (option 2)
- Change your default AI model (option 6)
- See current default model in the menu header
- Choose project paths
- Navigate through all features easily

**⚡ Direct Command Mode (For advanced users and automation)**

Run specific commands directly:

```bash
aiagent configure
aiagent project-brief                    # Optional but recommended
aiagent understand
aiagent create-documentation
aiagent create-business-documentation
```

---

### 1. First-Time Setup (Configure Authentication)

You can configure Databricks authentication in three ways:

**Option 1: Interactive Menu (Easiest)**

```bash
aiagent  # Select option 1 from the menu
```

**Option 2: Run `configure` command explicitly**

```bash
aiagent configure
```

**Option 3: Let the tool prompt you automatically on first use**

```bash
aiagent understand  # Will prompt for credentials if not configured
```

You'll be asked to provide:
- **Databricks Personal Access Token**: Get yours at https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html
- **Workspace URL**: Your Databricks serving endpoints URL (e.g., `https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/serving-endpoints`)

**Credential Storage (Cross-Platform)**:
- **Token**: Stored securely in your system's keyring
  - macOS: Keychain
  - Windows: Windows Credential Locker
  - Linux: Secret Service API (gnome-keyring, kwallet, etc.)
- **Workspace URL**: Stored in config file
  - macOS/Linux: `~/.config/aiagent/config.json`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\aiagent\config.json`

### 2. Create Project Brief (Optional but Recommended)

Provide context about your project to improve analysis accuracy and prevent hallucination:

```bash
# Create brief for current directory
aiagent project-brief

# Create brief for specific project
aiagent project-brief --project-path /path/to/project
```

**What is a Project Brief?**

A project brief answers 3 quick questions about your project:
1. **What is this project about?** - High-level overview
2. **What problem does it solve or what business value does it provide?** - Purpose and WHY
3. **Who are the target users or stakeholders?** - Audience and context

**Why is it important?**
- ✅ **Prevents Hallucination**: AI knows what the project is SUPPOSED to do
- ✅ **Improves Accuracy**: AI can validate code against stated intent
- ✅ **Better Documentation**: Generated docs align with actual project goals
- ✅ **Context-Aware Analysis**: AI understands business value, not just code structure

**Example Brief:**
```
What is this project about?
→ A web application for tracking customer orders and inventory

What problem does it solve?
→ Reduces manual order processing time by 80% and prevents inventory errors

Who are the target users?
→ Warehouse staff, inventory managers, and customer service teams
```

The brief is stored in `.aiagent/project-brief.json` and automatically used by all analysis and documentation commands.

**Tips:**
- You can skip any question by pressing Enter
- You can update the brief anytime by running the command again
- The brief is optional, but highly recommended for enterprise projects

### 3. Understanding Your Codebase

Analyze your project and build a knowledge base:

```bash
# Analyze current directory
aiagent understand

# Analyze specific project
aiagent understand --project-path /path/to/project

# The tool uses your default AI model
# To change the model, use the interactive menu (option 5) or change it via configuration
```

This command:
- Scans all relevant source files
- Analyzes project structure and architecture
- Identifies key components and relationships
- Uses project brief context if available (shows tip if not)
- Saves results to `.aiagent/knowledge.md`

### 4. Generate Technical Documentation

Create comprehensive technical documentation with architecture diagrams:

```bash
# Generate technical docs (uses your default AI model)
aiagent create-documentation
```

Generates:
- `.aiagent/technical-documentation.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `.aiagent/architecture.md` - Architecture-focused documentation
- Both include Mermaid diagrams for visualization
- Uses project brief context if available

### 5. Generate Business Documentation

Create business-friendly documentation for stakeholders with **intelligent questioning**:

```bash
# Generate business docs
aiagent create-business-documentation
```

This command uses **smart AI reasoning** to:
- Use project brief context if available for better business alignment
- Analyze your codebase and identify terms that are unclear from context
- **Intelligently decide** which questions to ask (0-7 questions, not always the same)
- Prioritize questions by business importance
- Show you **why** each question is being asked
- Translate technical concepts into business language
- Creates documentation focused on business value and capabilities
- Saves results to `.aiagent/business-documentation.md`
- Stores term mappings in `.aiagent/business-mappings.json`

**Smart Features:**
- ✅ **Context-aware**: Skips terms that can be understood from your code
- ✅ **Variable questions**: Asks 0-7 questions based on actual need (not fixed 5)
- ✅ **Reasoning shown**: See why each question matters
- ✅ **No duplicates**: AI reasoning prevents asking about the same concept twice

## Commands

### `aiagent configure`

Configure or update Databricks authentication credentials.

**Usage:**
```bash
aiagent configure
```

This command:
- Prompts for your Databricks Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Prompts for your Databricks workspace serving endpoints URL
- Stores credentials securely in system keyring (cross-platform)
- Can be re-run to update expired or changed credentials

**When to use:**
- First-time setup before running other commands
- When your token expires or is rotated
- When switching to a different Databricks workspace

### `aiagent project-brief`

Create or update a project brief to improve analysis accuracy and prevent AI hallucination.

**Usage:**
```bash
aiagent project-brief
aiagent project-brief --project-path /path/to/project
```

**Options:**
- `--project-path, -p PATH`: Path to project directory (default: current directory)

**What it does:**
- Asks 3 quick questions about your project (all optional):
  1. What is this project about?
  2. What problem does it solve or what business value does it provide?
  3. Who are the target users or stakeholders?
- Saves responses to `.aiagent/project-brief.json`
- Automatically used by `understand`, `create-documentation`, and `create-business-documentation`

**Why it's important:**
- **Prevents Hallucination**: AI knows what the project is SUPPOSED to do
- **Improves Accuracy**: AI validates code against stated project intent
- **Better Documentation**: Generated docs align with actual project goals
- **Context-Aware**: AI understands business value, not just code structure

**When to use:**
- After `configure`, before `understand` (recommended)
- When starting analysis of a new project
- When project goals or scope change
- To update outdated project context

**Note:** This is optional but highly recommended for enterprise projects.

### `aiagent understand`

Perform deep analysis of the project and build internal knowledge base.

**Options:**
- `--project-path, -p PATH`: Path to project directory (default: current directory)
- `--model, -m MODEL`: AI model to use (optional - uses your configured default)

**Available AI Models:**
- **Advanced Model** (default) - Best for sophisticated code analysis
- **Creative Model** - Optimized for creative documentation tasks
- **Analytics Model** - Specialized for analytical work

**Note:** Change your default model anytime via the interactive menu (option 5) or using `aiagent` and selecting "Change Model"

### `aiagent create-documentation`

Generate comprehensive technical documentation with Mermaid diagrams.

**Options:**
- `--project-path, -p PATH`: Path to project directory (default: current directory)
- `--model, -m MODEL`: AI model to use (optional - uses your configured default)

**Prerequisites:** Must run `aiagent understand` first.

### `aiagent create-business-documentation`

Generate business-level documentation with no technical jargon using **intelligent questioning**.

**Options:**
- `--project-path, -p PATH`: Path to project directory (default: current directory)
- `--model, -m MODEL`: AI model to use (optional - uses your configured default)

**Prerequisites:** Must run `aiagent understand` first.

**Smart Interactive Process:**
- Uses AI reasoning to determine which terms truly need clarification
- May ask **0-7 questions** (variable, based on need - not always 5)
- Shows **reasoning** for each question ("Why asking: ...")
- Context-aware: Skips terms that are clear from codebase
- Prioritizes questions by business importance

## Configuration

### Authentication and Model Selection

Credentials and settings are stored in:
- **Token**: System keyring (service: `aiagent-cli`, key: `databricks-token`)
  - Cross-platform support via `keyring` library
  - macOS: Keychain, Windows: Credential Locker, Linux: Secret Service
- **Configuration File** (workspace URL and default model):
  - macOS/Linux: `~/.config/aiagent/config.json`
  - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\aiagent\config.json`
  - Contains: `workspace_url` and `default_model`
  - Default model: **Advanced Model** (set on first configuration)

You can change the default model:
- **Interactive Menu**: Select option 5 "Change Model" to choose between Advanced, Creative, or Analytics models
- The selected model will be used automatically for all subsequent operations
- No need to specify technical model names or use the `--model` flag

### File Scanning

The tool automatically:
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- Excludes common directories: `node_modules`, `venv`, `.git`, `build`, etc.
- Filters relevant source files by extension
- Limits file size to 1MB per file

**Supported file types:**
- Programming: `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.java`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.c`, `.cpp`, etc.
- Web: `.html`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.vue`, `.svelte`
- Config: `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.xml`
- Documentation: `.md`, `.rst`
- Database: `.sql`
- And more...

### Performance & Scalability Features

**Smart File Prioritization:**
The tool automatically prioritizes files for analysis:
- **Priority 0 (Highest)**: Entry points (`main.py`, `app.py`, `index.js`, etc.)
- **Priority 1**: Configuration files (`setup.py`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, etc.)
- **Priority 2**: Regular source files
- **Priority 3**: Test files (included but deprioritized)
- **Priority 4**: Documentation files (lowest priority)

**Skipped Files:**
- Generated code (`.generated.`, `_pb2.`, protobuf files)
- Database migrations
- Test snapshots

**Parallel Processing:**
- Uses ThreadPoolExecutor with 4 workers
- Analyzes multiple files concurrently
- 4x faster than sequential analysis on large projects
- Automatic fallback to sequential for small projects (< 5 files)

**Incremental Analysis with Caching:**
- SQLite cache stored in `.aiagent/analysis_cache.db`
- Caches file analysis results with content hashing
- Only re-analyzes files that have changed since last run
- Dramatically speeds up subsequent analysis (10x+ faster)
- Cache statistics shown after analysis

**Semantic Code Chunking:**
- **Python files**: AST-based parsing to chunk by function/class definitions
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Regex-based parsing for functions and classes
- **Other files**: Intelligent line-based chunking with context preservation
- Keeps related code together for better AI comprehension

**Large Codebase Handling:**
- Efficiently processes 1000+ files
- Prioritizes top 130 files (10 entry points + 20 configs + 100 source files)
- Parallel analysis of top 50 files in detail
- Skips test files by default to focus on core logic

### Complete Workflow (Direct Commands)

```bash
# 0. First-time setup: Configure authentication
aiagent configure

# 1. Provide project context (optional but recommended)
cd my-project
aiagent project-brief
# Answer 3 quick questions about your project

# 2. Analyze your codebase
aiagent understand

# 3. Generate technical documentation
aiagent create-documentation

# 4. Generate business documentation
aiagent create-business-documentation

# 5. Review generated docs
ls -la .aiagent/
cat .aiagent/technical-documentation.md
```

### Changing AI Models

```bash
# Launch interactive menu
aiagent

# Select option 5 "Change Model"
# Choose from:
#   1. Advanced Model (best for sophisticated analysis)
#   2. Creative Model (optimized for creative tasks)
#   3. Analytics Model (specialized for analytical work)

# Your choice persists across all subsequent operations
```

### Analyzing External Projects

```bash
# Analyze a different project
aiagent understand --project-path ~/other-project

# Generate docs for it
aiagent create-documentation --project-path ~/other-project
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed: 401"

Your Databricks token may be expired. The tool will prompt you to reconfigure. Or manually update by deleting credentials and running again:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
rm ~/.config/aiagent/config.json
# Token will be cleared from keyring on next run

aiagent understand  # Will prompt for new credentials
```

### "Knowledge file not found"

You need to run `aiagent understand` before generating documentation:

```bash
aiagent understand
aiagent create-documentation
```

### Rate Limiting

If you hit rate limits, the tool will automatically retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts). If issues persist, wait a few minutes before trying again.

### Large Projects

The tool is optimized for large codebases (1000+ files):
- **Smart Prioritization**: Analyzes entry points and core files first
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes multiple files concurrently (4x faster)
- **Semantic Chunking**: Uses AST parsing to intelligently chunk code
- **Incremental Analysis**: Only re-analyzes changed files on subsequent runs
- **Caching**: Stores analysis results in `.aiagent/analysis_cache.db`

**Performance Tips:**
- First run may take longer as cache is being built
- Subsequent runs are 10x+ faster with caching
- Cache is automatically invalidated when files change
- To clear cache: `rm .aiagent/analysis_cache.db`

### Cache Issues

If you experience issues with cached analysis:

```bash
# Clear analysis cache
rm -f .aiagent/analysis_cache.db

# Re-run analysis
aiagent understand
```

The cache stores file analysis results and is safe to delete. It will be automatically rebuilt on the next run.

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability & Accuracy

The tool is built for professional use with enterprise-grade features to ensure complete, accurate documentation:

#### 🔄 **Automatic Response Continuation**

Prevents documentation truncation through intelligent continuation:
- **Finish Reason Detection**: Automatically detects when AI response hits token limits (`finish_reason='length'`)
- **Seamless Continuation**: Makes follow-up API calls to complete the response (up to 5 continuations)
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows "Response truncated. Continuing... (part N)" messages during generation
- **No Manual Intervention**: Completely automatic - handles truncation transparently

#### 🎯 **Model-Aware Token Management**

Optimized for Databricks API limits:
- **Claude Models**: 4,000 tokens per chunk (OTPM: 5,000/min)
- **GPT Models**: 8,000 tokens per chunk (OTPM: 5,000/min)
- **Gemini Models**: 12,000 tokens per chunk (OTPM: 20,000/min)

These conservative limits ensure reliability and enable seamless continuation without rate limiting.

#### ⏱️ **Smart Rate Limit Handling**

Professional retry logic with exponential backoff:
- **retry_after Header**: Respects Databricks' retry timing from 429 responses
- **Exponential Backoff**: 2^attempt seconds for connection errors
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows wait time and attempt count: "⏳ Rate limit hit. Waiting 30 seconds... (attempt 2/3)"
- **Automatic Recovery**: Transparently retries after rate limit cooldown

#### 🛡️ **Anti-Hallucination Grounding**

Prevents AI from inventing details not present in your code:
- **Strict Grounding Instructions**: Explicitly forbids mentioning tools/frameworks not in the code
- **No Assumptions**: AI cannot assume orchestration (Airflow, schedulers) unless present in imports
- **Source-Based Only**: Only describes what's actually visible in code structure and files
- **Clarity on Uncertainty**: States "Not visible in the provided codebase" rather than guessing

**Example**: If you provide a SQL file, the AI will only describe the SQL logic - it won't hallucinate about Apache Airflow orchestration or Databricks Workflows unless those appear in your actual codebase.

#### ✅ **Completion Verification**

Every generated document includes a verification footer:
```markdown
---

**Document completed by AI Agent CLI developed by Hossam. Thank you for using it!**
```

**What Completion Means:**
- With continuation: Document generated successfully (possibly across multiple API calls)
- Continuation count shown: "Technical doc generated with 2 continuation(s)"
- Footer present: All content delivered, no truncation

**Enterprise Benefits:**
- ✅ Handles projects with **1000+ files** and complex architectures
- ✅ Generates **complete** documentation for large codebases (no truncation)
- ✅ **Accurate** analysis grounded strictly in your actual code
- ✅ **Resilient** to rate limits with automatic retry and continuation
- ✅ **Professional** output suitable for enterprise documentation standards
