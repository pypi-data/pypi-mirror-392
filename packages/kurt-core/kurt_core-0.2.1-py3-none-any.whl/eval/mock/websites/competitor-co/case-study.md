# Case Study: StreamAPI

## The Challenge

StreamAPI is a real-time data platform serving 10M requests/day. They were using ACME but faced:

- High costs ($2,000/month for their traffic)
- Slow response times (P99 latency: 250ms)
- Complex deployment process (15+ minute deploys)
- Limited analytics and debugging tools

## The Solution

StreamAPI migrated to our platform in October 2024.

### Migration Process

1. **Automated migration** (10 minutes)
   - Converted ACME config format
   - Updated API endpoints
   - Migrated environment variables

2. **Testing** (2 hours)
   - Ran integration tests
   - Load testing with production traffic
   - Validated all edge cases

3. **Gradual rollout** (1 week)
   - Started with 10% of traffic
   - Monitored performance metrics
   - Scaled to 100% after 3 days

Total migration time: **1 week from start to 100% migration**

## Results

### Cost Savings: 60%

Before (ACME):
- $2,000/month base plan
- $500/month overage fees
- **Total: $2,500/month**

After (Our Platform):
- $99/month Team plan
- $200/month bandwidth add-ons
- $500/month for extra requests
- **Total: $799/month**

**Savings: $1,701/month ($20,412/year)**

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before (ACME) | After (Us) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| P50 latency | 120ms | 45ms | **62% faster** |
| P99 latency | 250ms | 89ms | **64% faster** |
| Cold start | 18ms | 8ms | **56% faster** |
| Deploy time | 15 min | 20 sec | **98% faster** |
| Uptime | 99.9% | 99.99% | **10x better** |

### Developer Experience

"The deployment experience is night and day. We went from 15-minute deploys to 20 seconds. Our engineers can ship features 10x faster now." - Mike Rodriguez, Lead Engineer

### Business Impact

- **Customer satisfaction:** Up 25% (faster response times)
- **Developer productivity:** Up 40% (faster deploys)
- **Infrastructure costs:** Down 60%
- **Incident response time:** Down 80% (better debugging tools)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Migration is easy:** Automated tools made migration painless
2. **Performance gains are real:** 60%+ latency improvements across the board
3. **Cost savings are significant:** $20K/year saved on infrastructure
4. **Developer happiness matters:** Faster deploys = happier engineers
