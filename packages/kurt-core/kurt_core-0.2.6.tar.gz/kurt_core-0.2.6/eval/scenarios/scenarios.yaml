# All test scenarios in one file for easier management.
# Each scenario tests specific Kurt agent behavior.

scenarios:
  # ========================================================================
  # Scenario 01: Basic Initialization
  # ========================================================================
  - name: 01_basic_init

  # ========================================================================
  # Scenario 02: Add Content from URL (Using Mock HTTP Server)
  # ========================================================================
  - name: 02_add_url
    description: Initialize Kurt and discover/fetch content from mocked URL

    notes: |
      Tests content discovery and fetching using mock HTTP server.
      Mock data includes sitemap with 6 URLs (home, about, pricing, 3 blog posts).
      HTTP requests are intercepted by local proxy server - no real network calls!
      Uses HTTP (not HTTPS) to avoid SSL complications in testing.
      The httpx fetch engine is automatically configured in kurt.config.

      http://acme-corp.com/

      You are a content marketing manager at ACME Corp, the API management platform.

      ## Your Company Profile
      - **Website:** http://acme-corp.com
      - **Documentation:** http://docs.acme-corp.com
      - **Target audience:** Software engineers, DevOps teams, API developers
      - **Product:** API management platform for deploying and scaling APIs

      ## Your Current Situation
      You're preparing to write technical content about best practices for building scalable APIs.
      You need to reference ACME's own documentation to ensure accuracy and consistency with
      the product's features.

      ## Your Goal with Kurt
      You want to gather reference material from ACME's technical documentation. This will
      help you create blog posts and guides that align with ACME's product capabilities.

      ## Your Project Details
      - Project name: "api-scaling-content"
      - Goal: Create technical content about API best practices
      - You want to write new blog posts and guides
      - Source: http://docs.acme-corp.com/ (gather the getting started guide and API reference)
      - This is your first Kurt project, so skip any foundation setup for now

      Respond naturally to questions based on this context. Keep responses brief and conversational.

  # ========================================================================
  # Scenario 05: Setup Kurt Foundations (Using Mocks)
  # ========================================================================
  - name: 05_setup_foundations
    description: Complete foundation setup - init, content discovery, fetching, and rule extraction using mock data

    notes: |
      Tests the full foundation workflow that should happen before creating content:
      1. Initialize Kurt project
      2. Discover and fetch content from organizational source (ACME Corp blog)
      3. Extract publisher profile rules
      4. Extract primary style/voice rules

      Uses mocked HTTP responses for fast, reproducible testing.
      This establishes the "organizational foundation" referenced in project workflows.

    initial_prompt: |
      Setup Kurt foundations by doing the following:

      1. Initialize a Kurt project if needed
      2. Discover and fetch content from http://acme-corp.com/ (the company blog with technical articles)
      3. After fetching completes, extract publisher profile rules using the writing-rules-skill
      4. Extract primary style rules using the writing-rules-skill

      The goal is to fetch content and extract foundational rules that would apply to all future content creation.

  # Scenario 06: Pre-configured Project with Setup Commands
  # ========================================================================
  - name: 06_preconfigured_project
    description: Test scenario with a fully pre-configured project using setup_commands

    notes: |
      Demonstrates the setup_commands feature which runs bash commands before
      the scenario starts. This is useful for:
      - Creating a complete project structure
      - Pre-populating databases
      - Fetching content ahead of time
      - Setting up complex test environments

      This scenario creates a project with sources and rules already in place,
      then asks the agent to verify the setup and create an outline.

    # Commands run BEFORE the agent receives the initial prompt
    setup_commands:
      - mkdir -p projects/demo-blog/sources projects/demo-blog/drafts
      - echo "# Demo Blog\n\nGoal: Create technical blog posts about AI tools" > projects/demo-blog/project.md
      - mkdir -p rules/publisher rules/style
      - echo "# Publisher Profile\n\n## Core Identity\nWe are a technical publisher focused on AI tooling." > rules/publisher/publisher-profile.md
      - echo "# Primary Voice & Style Guide\n\n## Voice Characteristics\n- Clear and concise\n- Technical but approachable" > rules/style/primary.md
      - echo "Test source content" > projects/demo-blog/sources/test-article.md

      2. Publisher profile rules are available
      3. Primary style rules are available
      4. Source content exists
