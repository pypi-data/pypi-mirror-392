# ADD-FEEDBACK.md

## When to use this instruction
Collect user feedback about Kurt's output quality to improve the system.

Use when:
- User expresses dissatisfaction with output quality
- At the end of a significant project or writing workflow
- User explicitly provides feedback about the system

---

## How to Collect Feedback

Ask the user two simple questions:

1. **Did the output meet your expectations?** (Pass/Fail)
   - Pass (1) = Output met expectations
   - Fail (0) = Output did not meet expectations

2. **Any feedback you'd like to share?** (Optional comment)
   - Freeform text about what worked or didn't work
   - Specific issues or suggestions for improvement

---

## Logging Feedback

Once you've collected feedback, log it:

```bash
# Output passed
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --passed \
  --event-id <uuid>

# Output failed with comment
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --comment "<user's feedback>" \
  --event-id <uuid>

# Output passed with comment
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --passed \
  --comment "<user's feedback>" \
  --event-id <uuid>
```

**Parameters:**
- `--passed`: Flag for pass (1), omit for fail (0)
- `--comment`: Optional freeform feedback text
- `--event-id`: Required UUID for this feedback event

---

## When to Request Feedback

**Good times to ask:**
- After completing a multi-document project
- After a significant writing task (blog post, product page, etc.)
- When user expresses frustration or dissatisfaction
- After trying a new format template for the first time

**Don't ask too frequently:**
- Not after every small edit or single document
- Not more than once per session
- Skip if user is clearly in a rush

---

## Example Workflows

### Pass with positive feedback
```
You: "I've completed the blog post draft. Did it meet your expectations?"

User: "Yes, this is great! The tone is perfect."

You: "That's wonderful to hear! Mind if I log that feedback?"

User: "Sure."

[Run command]:
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --passed \
  --comment "Tone is perfect" \
  --event-id <uuid>

You: "Thanks for the feedback!"
```

### Fail with specific issues
```
You: "I've finished the product page. How does it look?"

User: "It's not quite right - the tone is too formal for our brand."

You: "I appreciate that feedback. Would you say it didn't meet expectations overall?"

User: "Correct, I'll need to revise it."

You: "Got it. Let me log that feedback so we can improve."

[Run command]:
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --comment "Tone too formal for brand" \
  --event-id <uuid>

You: "Thanks! Would you like me to revise the draft with a more casual tone?"
```

### Pass without comment
```
You: "The documentation is ready. Did it turn out how you wanted?"

User: "Yes, looks good."

[Run command]:
kurt admin feedback log-submission \
  --passed \
  --event-id <uuid>

You: "Great!"
```

## Notes

- Feedback is sent to PostHog for anonymous analytics
- Only pass/fail and comment length are tracked (not the comment content itself)
- Comments help you understand what to improve in the current session
- Be gracious when receiving negative feedback - it helps improve the system
