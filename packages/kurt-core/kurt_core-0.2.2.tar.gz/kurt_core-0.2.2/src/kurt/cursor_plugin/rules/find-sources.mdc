# FIND-SOURCES.md

## When to use this instruction
Discovering and retrieving existing content from Kurt's database.

Use this instruction when:
- User wants to find existing sources on a topic
- Need to discover related or prerequisite content
- Exploring what content exists before fetching new sources

---

## Discovery Methods

### 1. Topic/Technology Discovery
See what topics and technologies exist across indexed content, identify coverage gaps.

```bash
# See all indexed topics with document counts
kurt content list-topics

# See common topics (in 5+ documents)
kurt content list-topics --min-docs 5

# See all indexed technologies
kurt content list-technologies

# Filter to docs section only
kurt content list-topics --include "*/docs/*"
kurt content list-technologies --include "*/docs/*"

# JSON output for programmatic use
kurt content list-topics --format json
```

**Use when**: Understanding what topics/tech are covered, identifying content gaps, planning what to fetch

**Workflow example:**
1. Run `kurt content list-topics` → See topics like "authentication" (15 docs), "webhooks" (3 docs)
2. Notice "webhooks" has low coverage
3. Run `kurt content list --with-topic "webhooks"` → See which 3 docs exist
4. Identify need for more webhook content → fetch additional webhook guides

---

### 2. Semantic Search
Full-text search through fetched document content.

```bash
# Search all content
kurt content search "authentication"

# Filter by URL pattern
kurt content search "webhooks" --include "*/docs/*"

# Case-sensitive
kurt content search "OAuth" --case-sensitive
```

**Use when**: Finding documents by keyword, searching for specific concepts

**Requires**: ripgrep (`brew install ripgrep`)

---

### 3. Cluster-Based Discovery
Browse content organized by topic clusters.

```bash
# See all topic clusters
kurt content list-clusters

# List documents in a cluster
kurt content list --in-cluster "API Tutorials"

# Fetch all documents in a cluster
kurt content fetch --in-cluster "Getting Started" --priority 1
```

**Use when**: Exploring content by theme, large content collections

**Note**: Clusters created during mapping with `--cluster-urls` flag

---

### 4. Link-Based Discovery
Navigate document relationships through internal links.

```bash
# Show outbound links from a document
kurt content links <doc-id> --direction outbound

# Show inbound links to a document
kurt content links <doc-id> --direction inbound
```

**Use when**: Finding prerequisite reading, discovering related content, understanding dependencies

**How Claude interprets anchor text:**
- "Prerequisites", "Read this first", "Before you start" → prerequisite docs
- "See also", "Related", "Learn more about" → related content
- "Example", "Try this", "Sample" → example docs
- Other anchor text → general references

---

### 5. Indexed Metadata Search
Filter by topics, technologies, and content characteristics extracted during indexing.

```bash
# Filter by topic
kurt content list --with-topic "authentication"
kurt content list --with-topic "API"

# Filter by technology
kurt content list --with-technology "Python"
kurt content list --with-technology "Docker"

# Combine metadata filters
kurt content list --with-content-type tutorial --with-technology "React"
kurt content list --with-topic "deployment" --with-technology "Kubernetes"

# View indexed metadata
kurt content get <doc-id>  # Shows topics, technologies, content type, structural flags
```

**Use when**: Filtering by extracted topics, technologies, or content type

**Note**: Requires running `kurt content index` first to extract metadata. See `add-source.md` for indexing workflow.

**Available filters:**
- `--with-topic`: Filter by topics in `primary_topics` (case-insensitive substring match)
- `--with-technology`: Filter by tools/technologies in `tools_technologies` (case-insensitive substring match)
- `--with-content-type`: Filter by content type (tutorial, guide, blog, reference, etc.)

---

### 6. Direct Retrieval
Query documents by metadata, status, or properties.

```bash
# All documents
kurt content list

# Filter by URL pattern
kurt content list --include "*/docs/*"
kurt content list --include "https://example.com*"

# Filter by status
kurt content list --with-status FETCHED
kurt content list --with-status NOT_FETCHED

# Filter by content type
kurt content list --with-content-type tutorial

# Filter by cluster
kurt content list --in-cluster "API Guides"

# Combine filters
kurt content list --with-status FETCHED --include "*/api/*" --with-content-type reference

# Get specific document
kurt content get <doc-id>

# Content statistics
kurt content stats
kurt content stats --include "*docs.example.com*"
```

**Use when**: Need specific filtering by URL, status, type, or analytics

## Which Method to Use?

**I want to understand what topics/tech are covered** → Topic/Technology Discovery
- Example: "What topics do we have content about?" → `kurt content list-topics`
- Example: "Do we have Docker content?" → `kurt content list-technologies`
- Example: "Which topics need more docs?" → `kurt content list-topics` (look for low counts)

**I know the exact topic/keyword** → Semantic Search
- Example: "Find all docs mentioning webhooks"

**I want docs about a specific topic or technology** → Indexed Metadata Search
- Example: "Show me all Python tutorials" → `kurt content list --with-content-type tutorial --with-technology Python`
- Example: "Find authentication guides" → `kurt content list --with-topic authentication`

**I want to explore by theme** → Cluster-Based Discovery
- Example: "Show me all tutorial content"

**I have a document and want related ones** → Link-Based Discovery
- Example: "Show me links from this doc" → Check anchor text for relationships

**I need specific filtering** → Direct Retrieval
- Example: "Show all FETCHED docs from /docs/ that are tutorials"
