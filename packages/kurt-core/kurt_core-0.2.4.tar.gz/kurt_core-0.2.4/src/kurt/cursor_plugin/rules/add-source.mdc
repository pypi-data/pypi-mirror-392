# ADD-SOURCE.md

## When to use this instruction
User shares URL, CMS content, or pastes text → Ingest for use in writing projects.

All operations return status + file paths created.

## Source Type Detection & Routing

Detect source type using these signals, then route to appropriate workflow:

### 1. CMS Content
**URL Patterns**: `*.sanity.studio/*`, `app.contentful.com/*`, `*/wp-admin/*`
**Natural Language**: "from my CMS", "in Sanity", "our Contentful", "WordPress content"
**Action**: → CMS Workflow

### 2. Single Web Page
**URL Patterns**: Specific page URL beyond homepage (e.g., `/blog/article-name`, `/docs/guide-name`)
**Natural Language**: "this article", "this page", "this guide"
**Action**: → Single Page Workflow

### 3. Full Website/Domain
**URL Patterns**: Homepage or subdomain root (ends with `/` or domain only)
**Natural Language**: "their docs", "competitor site", "the website", "their blog"
**Action**: → Full Site Workflow

### 4. Pasted Content
**Pattern**: Multi-line text blob (>100 chars, no URL)
**Detection**: User pastes markdown, code, or text directly into chat
**Action**: → Pasted Content Workflow

## CMS Workflow

### Step 1: Check Configuration
Run: `kurt integrations cms status`

- **Not configured** → Offer: "I see you're using {platform}. Set it up now? Takes 2 minutes."
  - If yes: `kurt integrations cms onboard --platform {platform}`
  - If no: Stop here
- **Configured** → Continue to Step 2

### Step 2: Determine Scope & Execute

**A. Single Document** (user provides specific CMS URL or document name)

User shared specific document → fetch immediately:
```bash
# Search to find it
kurt integrations cms search --platform {platform} --query "{doc_name_or_id}"

# Map and fetch inline (priority 1 - immediate)
kurt content map cms --platform {platform} --instance {instance}
kurt content fetch --with-status NOT_FETCHED --priority 1
```

Result: "Fetched '{title}' from {platform}. Ready to use."

**B. Search & Select** (user describes content, doesn't know exact doc)

User describes what they need → search and let them pick:
```bash
# Search
kurt integrations cms search --platform {platform} --query "{user_description}"

# Show results to user, they select which ones
# Then fetch selected (priority 1)
kurt content fetch --url {selected_urls} --priority 1
```

**C. Bulk Import** (user wants "all articles", entire content type, or full CMS)

User wants large import → map WITH clustering, fetch in background:
```bash
# Map + cluster in one command
kurt content map cms --platform {platform} --instance {instance} \
  --content-type {type} --cluster-urls

# Then fetch relevant clusters in background
kurt content fetch --in-cluster "{relevant_cluster}" --priority 5 --background
```

Tell user: "Mapped {count} {content_type} documents and created {cluster_count} topic clusters. Fetching {relevant_cluster} in background for your {project_goal}."

**Why cluster CMS content?**
- Groups articles by topic automatically
- Enables fetching by theme instead of guessing URL patterns
- Project-aware: Fetch "API Tutorials" cluster for tutorial project, skip "Blog Posts" cluster

---

## Single Page Workflow

User shared specific page URL → fetch immediately (fast operation):

```bash
# Priority 1 - inline, immediate
kurt content fetch --url {url} --priority 1
```

Result: Show summary immediately:
- "Fetched: {title}"
- "Type: {content_type}, {word_count} words"
- If in project: "Added to project sources."

**No verification needed** - synchronous operation, result is immediate.

---

## Full Site Workflow

### Step 1: Quick Size Estimate

Run dry-run to check size (fast, doesn't save):
```bash
kurt content map url {homepage_url} --dry-run
```

### Step 2: Smart Execution Based on Size

**Small site (<50 pages)**:
Map + fetch inline (fast enough to not block):
```bash
kurt content map url {homepage_url}
kurt content fetch --with-status NOT_FETCHED --priority 1
```
Tell user: "Mapped and fetched 30 pages from {domain}."

**Medium site (50-200 pages)**:
Map inline, fetch selectively in background:
```bash
# Map first (quick)
kurt content map url {homepage_url}

# Detect sections, fetch relevant ones in background
kurt content fetch --include "{relevant_sections}" --background --priority 5
```
Tell user: "Mapped {count} pages from {domain}. Fetching {relevant_sections} in background for your {project_goal}."

**Large site (>200 pages)**:
Map inline WITH clustering, fetch in background:
```bash
# Map + cluster in one command (LLM creates topic clusters automatically)
kurt content map url {homepage_url} --cluster-urls

# Then fetch relevant clusters in background
kurt content fetch --in-cluster "{cluster_name}" --background --priority 10
```
Tell user: "Mapping {domain}... Found {count} pages and created {cluster_count} topic clusters. Fetching {relevant_cluster} in background for your {project_goal}. Let's continue."

**Why cluster during map?**
- Organizes content immediately for intelligent fetching
- Clusters based on URL patterns, titles, descriptions (doesn't need FETCHED content)
- Enables cluster-based source discovery later

### Step 3: Project-Aware Section Selection

**If in project context**, intelligently determine which sections to fetch:

**Tutorial/Guide Project**:
- Fetch: `/docs/*`, `/guides/*`, `/tutorials/*`, `/learn/*`
- Skip: `/blog/*`, `/about/*`, `/pricing/*`, `/legal/*`

**Product Page Project**:
- Fetch: homepage, `/product/*`, `/features/*`, `/solutions/*`, `/integrations/*`
- Skip: `/blog/*`, `/support/*`, `/docs/*`, `/careers/*`

**Blog/Thought Leadership Project**:
- Fetch: `/blog/*` (filter by keywords related to project topic)
- Skip: `/docs/*`, `/product/*`, `/support/*`

**Competitive Analysis Project**:
- Fetch: homepage, 2-3 key product/feature pages (not entire site)
- Skip: blog archives, full documentation

**No Project Context**:
Ask user: "Found {count} pages on {domain}. Which sections should I fetch now?"
- Show detected sections: "`/docs/` (50 pages), `/blog/` (120 pages), `/api/` (30 pages)"
- User picks sections, or "all", or "just map for now"

### Step 4: Background Operation Updates

For background operations, update user periodically (if >2 minutes):
```
[Update after 2 min]: Mapping stripe.com: 85/200 pages discovered...
[Update after 5 min]: Fetching /docs/*: 25/50 pages complete...
[Complete]: Finished! Indexed 200 pages from stripe.com.
```

User can continue conversation while this runs.

## Pasted Content Workflow

User pasted text blob → save and index immediately:

### Step 1: Detect Format
- **Markdown with YAML frontmatter** → `.md`
- **Plain markdown** (headings, lists, etc.) → `.md`
- **Code** (detect language from syntax) → `.{language}`
- **Plain text** → `.txt`

### Step 2: Save to Project Sources

Determine path:
- **In project**: `/projects/{project-name}/sources/{descriptive-name}.{ext}`
- **Not in project**: `/sources/{descriptive-name}.{ext}`

Infer descriptive name from:
- Frontmatter title (if present)
- First heading (if markdown)
- First line (if plain text, cleaned up)

### Step 3: Index Immediately

```bash
# Priority 1 - inline
kurt content fetch --file {filepath} --priority 1
```

### Step 4: Confirm

"Saved as `{filepath}` and indexed. Ready to use for your {document_type}."

---

## Priority Assignment (Automatic)

**IMPORTANT**: Never ask user about priority or background mode. Infer automatically from context:

**Priority 1 (Immediate - Run Inline)**:
- Single pages user explicitly shared
- CMS docs user mentioned by name
- Pasted content
- Small sites (<50 pages)
- Any source user is actively waiting for

**Priority 5 (Background - Medium)**:
- Medium sites (50-200 pages)
- CMS bulk imports (specific content type)
- Related research materials
- Competitor site analysis

**Priority 10 (Background - Low)**:
- Fetching from large sites (>200 pages) after mapping
- Fetching from full CMS imports (all content types) after mapping
- Reference materials during profile setup
- Exploratory/future research

**IMPORTANT**: Mapping always runs inline (foreground) so we know what sections/content exists before deciding what to fetch.

---

## Result Handling

### Inline Operations (Priority 1)
Show immediate result in conversation:
```
✓ Fetched: "Getting Started with Stripe"
  Type: Tutorial, 2,400 words
  Added to project sources.
```

Continue conversation immediately - no "verification" step needed.

### Background Operations (Priority 5+)
Acknowledge start, don't block:
```
Mapping docs.stripe.com in background (est. 5 min)...
[Continue conversation while it runs]
```

When complete (if user is still in session):
```
✓ Finished mapping docs.stripe.com - 180 pages indexed.
  Fetched /docs/* and /guides/* for your API integration tutorial.
```

### Project Context Updates
If in project, silently update plan with:
- New sources added
- Relevant page counts
- Status: mapped, fetched, ready to use

Show summary: "Project now has {count} sources ({relevant_count} directly relevant to {goal})."

---

## Content Indexing

After fetching content, Kurt can extract metadata (topics, technologies, content type, structural features) to enable better discovery.

### When to Index

**Automatically indexed during fetch**: Most content is automatically indexed when fetched.

**Manual indexing**: Run after bulk fetches or to re-index with updated extraction logic:

```bash
# Index all fetched content
kurt content index --all

# Index specific document
kurt content index <doc-id>

# Index by URL pattern
kurt content index --include "*/docs/*"
```

### What Gets Extracted

- **Content Type**: tutorial, guide, blog, reference, product_page, etc.
- **Topics**: Primary topics covered (e.g., "authentication", "API design", "deployment")
- **Technologies**: Tools/languages mentioned (e.g., "Python", "Docker", "PostgreSQL")
- **Structure**: Code examples, step-by-step procedures, narrative structure

### Using Indexed Metadata

After indexing, filter content by extracted metadata:

```bash
# Find Python tutorials
kurt content list --with-content-type tutorial --with-technology Python

# Find docs about authentication
kurt content list --with-topic authentication

# View indexed metadata
kurt content get <doc-id>
```

See @find-sources rule for complete discovery methods.

---

## Deep Source Analysis & Discovery

After sources are fetched and indexed, use @find-sources rule for discovering and retrieving content (semantic search, cluster navigation, link analysis, filtered queries).

This is typically used during project planning (see @add-project rule steps 5.5, 8, 9) or referenced by format templates.

## Examples

**Example 1: User in Product Page Project**
```
User: "Check out stripe.com"

Claude:
- Detects: Full site
- Runs: kurt content map url https://stripe.com --dry-run
- Sees: 180 pages (medium size)
- Context: Product page project
- Action: Map inline → fetch /product/*, /features/* in background (priority 5)
- Says: "Mapping stripe.com... Found 180 pages. Fetching product and feature pages in background for your product page. Let's continue with your draft..."
```

**Example 2: User Shares Specific Article**
```
User: "Use this article: https://example.com/blog/best-practices"

Claude:
- Detects: Single page
- Action: kurt content fetch --url {url} --priority 1 (inline)
- Says: "✓ Fetched: 'API Design Best Practices' (2,100 words). Added to sources."
```

**Example 3: CMS Bulk Import**
```
