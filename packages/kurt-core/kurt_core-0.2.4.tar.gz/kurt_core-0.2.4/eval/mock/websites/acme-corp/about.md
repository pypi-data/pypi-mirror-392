# About ACME

We're on a mission to make API development as simple as writing a function.

## Our Story

ACME started in 2022 when our founders—former engineers at Stripe and Vercel—got tired of spending more time configuring infrastructure than actually building products.

We asked ourselves: *Why is deploying an API still so hard?*

The answer wasn't technology. The tools existed. The problem was **complexity**.

So we built ACME: an API platform that feels like magic, but is actually just really good engineering.

## Our Principles

**Developer Experience First**
Every feature we ship passes one test: Does this make developers' lives better? If not, we don't ship it.

**No Surprises**
Predictable pricing. Clear documentation. Transparent roadmap. You'll never wonder what's happening behind the scenes.

**Build for Scale**
Whether you're a solo developer or a Series C startup, ACME scales with you. Same great experience, zero to millions of requests.

**Open & Honest**
We share our metrics, our challenges, and our learnings. Check out our [public roadmap](https://roadmap.acme-corp.com) and [status page](https://status.acme-corp.com).

## The Team

We're a team of 28 engineers, designers, and developer advocates across San Francisco, London, and remote.

**Leadership**
- **Maya Patel** - CEO & Co-founder (ex-Stripe Platform)
- **Jordan Kim** - CTO & Co-founder (ex-Vercel Edge Runtime)
- **Sam Martinez** - VP Engineering (ex-GitHub Actions)

**Backed By**
- Sequoia Capital
- Andreessen Horowitz

## Our Values

1. **Ship Fast** - Move quickly, iterate, learn
2. **Be Human** - Empathy in everything we build
3. **Stay Curious** - Always ask "why?" and "what if?"
4. **Own It** - Take responsibility, fix problems
5. **Lift Others** - Share knowledge, help developers succeed
