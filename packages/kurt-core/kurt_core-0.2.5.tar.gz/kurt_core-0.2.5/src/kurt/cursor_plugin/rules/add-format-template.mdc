## When to use this instruction
To create a new format template or customize an existing format template's style guidelines.

## Steps to execute

1. Determine the task:

   **Customizing existing template's style?** → Follow "Customize style guidelines" below
   **Creating new format template?** → Follow "Create new format" below

### Customize style guidelines

Use this when a format template exists but needs its style customized for the user's company (fills in "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section).

1. Ask: "Which format template do you want to customize?"
   - Or identify from user's request (e.g., "blog post", "tutorial")

2. List available templates: `ls kurt/templates/formats/`

3. Load the format template file

4. Check if "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" section exists
   - If already customized → Ask if they want to update it
   - If needs customization → Continue with workflow

5. Find example content for style analysis:
   ```bash
   # Search based on format type (adjust for format)
   kurt content list --url-contains /blog/     # For blog posts
   kurt content list --url-contains /docs/     # For tutorials
   ```

6. Offer user 3-5 examples to analyze:
   - Show URLs/titles found
   - Ask: "Use these for style analysis, or provide different URLs?"

7. If user provides URLs:
   ```bash
   kurt content fetch --urls "<url1>,<url2>,<url3>"
   ```

8. If user pastes text:
   - Save to `projects/<project>/style-examples/<filename>.md`

9. Analyze examples following the template's "Customizing This Template" section:
   - Read each example
   - Note style patterns (tone, structure, voice, formatting)
   - Copy actual examples that show their style
   - Create contrasting "don't" examples
   - Identify DO/DON'T patterns

10. Update the Style Guidelines section in the format template:
    - Replace "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" with analyzed patterns
    - Include actual examples from their content
    - Add DO/DON'T pairs with reasoning

11. Confirm updates with user

### Create new format

Use this when user needs a format template that doesn't exist yet.

1. Ask user to describe the format:
   - What type of content? (email, landing page, case study, etc.)
   - What's the purpose?
   - Typical length?
   - Key success metrics?

2. Ask if they have examples to analyze:
   - "Do you have 3-5 examples of this format from your company or others?"
   - If yes → Collect URLs or pasted content
   - If no → Work from description only

3. Draft format template structure (use existing templates as reference):

   **Section 1: Overview**
   - Purpose, length, success metrics

   **Section 2: Style Guidelines**
   - If have examples → Analyze and populate
   - If no examples → Include "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" placeholder

   **Section 3: Research Requirements** (if applicable)
   - Types of research that strengthen this format
   - Kurt commands to gather research

   **Section 4: Source Requirements**
   - What sources typically needed
   - Kurt commands to find them

   **Section 5: Structure**
   - Template structure in markdown
   - Include section descriptions

   **Section 6: Workflow**
   - How to go from outline to draft
   - YAML frontmatter format
   - Source tracking

   **Section 7: Customizing This Template** (if has placeholder)
   - Instructions for one-time style analysis setup
   - What to look for
   - How to populate style guidelines

4. Review draft with user iteratively

5. Ask for template filename (descriptive, kebab-case, e.g., `case-study.md`)

6. Write to @kurt/templates/formats/{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}.md

7. If has "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" placeholder:
   - Ask: "Want to customize the style now or later?"
   - If now → Follow "Customize style guidelines" workflow above
   - If later → Explain they can customize when first using it

8. Confirm template created

## Format template structure

A format template contains:

1. **Overview** - Purpose, length, success metrics

2. **Style Guidelines** - Voice, tone, structure, DO/DON'T examples
   - May include "[CUSTOMIZATION NEEDED]" placeholder if not yet customized

3. **Research Requirements** (optional) - Types of research + kurt commands

4. **Source Requirements** - What sources needed + kurt commands to find them

5. **Structure** - Markdown template showing expected structure

6. **Workflow** - How to create outline → draft, YAML frontmatter format

7. **Customizing This Template** (if has placeholder) - Instructions for one-time style setup
