## When to use this instruction
To modify the base project plan template, modify an existing saved project template, or create a new saved project template.

## Steps to execute

1. Determine the modification type:

   **Modifying base plan template?** → Follow "Modify base plan" below
   **Modifying existing saved template?** → Follow "Modify saved template" below
   **Creating new saved template?** → Follow "Create saved template" below

### Modify base plan

Use this when the change applies to ALL projects (e.g., adding a new section that every project needs).

1. Ask: "Does this change apply to all projects, or just specific types of projects?"
   - If all projects → Continue with this workflow
   - If specific types → Skip to "Create saved template" or "Modify saved template"

2. Load @kurt/templates/plan-template.md (the <base_plan_template>)

3. Make requested modifications to the <base_plan_template>

4. Explain what changed and confirm with user

### Modify saved template

Use this when updating an existing saved project template in @kurt/templates/projects/.

1. List available saved templates: `ls kurt/templates/projects/`

2. Ask user which template to modify (or identify from their request)

3. Load the <saved_plan_template> file

4. Make requested modifications to:
   - Setup instructions (HTML comment at top)
   - Pre-filled plan structure
   - Placeholders

5. Confirm changes with user

### Create saved template

Use this when creating a new reusable project template. Can start from an existing project or from scratch.

**From existing project:**

1. Ask: "Do you have an existing project plan you'd like to turn into a template?"
   - If yes → Continue with "From existing project" workflow
   - If no → Skip to "From scratch" workflow

2. Load the user's existing `plan.md` from their project folder

3. Work with user to create setup instructions:
   - What questions should Claude ask when cloning this template?
   - What `kurt` commands should be run during setup?
   - What information needs to be gathered?

4. Convert the plan to template format:
   - Add setup instructions as HTML comment at top
   - Replace specific values with `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`
   - Identify what gets populated during setup vs. execution

5. Ask user for template name (descriptive, kebab-case, e.g., `tutorial-refresh.md`)

6. Write to @kurt/templates/projects/{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}.md

7. Confirm template created and explain how to use it

**From scratch:**

1. Ask user to describe the project type and its purpose

2. Ask about the typical workflow:
   - What setup is required?
   - What questions need answering upfront?
   - What `kurt` commands are typically run?
   - What documents are typically produced?
   - What sources are typically needed?

3. Draft setup instructions based on workflow:
   - Questions to ask user
   - Kurt commands to run
   - How to populate the plan

4. Draft pre-filled plan structure using <base_plan_template> as base:
   - Customize sections for this project type
   - Add `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` for values populated during setup
   - Include helpful examples in comments

5. Review with user iteratively, adjusting as needed

6. Ask user for template name (descriptive, kebab-case)

7. Write to @kurt/templates/projects/{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}.md

8. Confirm template created and explain how to use it

## Saved template structure

A saved project template contains:

1. **Setup instructions** (HTML comment at top):
   - Questions to ask user
   - Kurt commands to run
   - How to populate the plan based on results

2. **Pre-filled plan** (rest of file):
   - Copy of `plan-template.md` structure
   - Pre-populated sections specific to this project type
   - `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` for values filled during setup
   - Helpful examples in comments

See @kurt/templates/projects/tutorial-refresh.md for reference example.
