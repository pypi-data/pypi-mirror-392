    """
        A utility class for managing Google Sheets at the spreadsheet level.

        SmartSpread provides functionality to interact with a Google spreadsheet,
        including creating new spreadsheets, managing access, retrieving tabs, and
        caching data for improved performance.

        Attributes:
            sheet_identifier (str): Identifier for the spreadsheet, either its name or ID.
            directory (str): Directory for storing cached data.
            user_email (str): Email of the user to share the spreadsheet with (optional).
            key_file (str): Path to the Google service account key file for authentication.
            clear_cache (bool): Whether to clear the cache on initialization.

        Methods:
            sheet: Retrieves the spreadsheet object, creating it if it doesn't exist.
            create_sheet(): Creates a new spreadsheet.
            grant_access(email, role): Grants access to the spreadsheet for a user.
            url: Returns the URL of the spreadsheet.
            tab(tab_name, data_format, keep_number_formatting, clear_cache):
                Creates or retrieves a `SmartTab` object for the specified tab.
            tab_names: Returns a list of tab names in the spreadsheet.
            tab_exists(tab_name): Checks if a tab with the given name exists in the spreadsheet.
