## Problem: Assigning Shifts to Employees

We need to assign 2 employees to work 3 shifts (morning, afternoon, evening). Each shift must be covered by exactly one employee. However, employees have preferences about which shifts they like or dislike.

The goal is to:

- Ensure each shift is covered by exactly one employee.
- Assign at most 2 shifts to any employee.
- Prefer assigning employees to their preferred shifts.
