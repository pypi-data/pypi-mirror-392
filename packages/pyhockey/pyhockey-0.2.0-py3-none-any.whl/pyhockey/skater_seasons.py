    """ Return skater-level season summary data

    Primary function for retrieving skater-level season summaries. Given a season or list of
    seasons, return skater data summaries for each of those seasons. 

    Can also provide a name or list of names to get only summaries for specific player(s).

    Can provide further filters via a team or list of teams, a minimum icetime cutoff, or
    a specific situation/game state.

    Args:

        season: 
            The (list of) season(s) for which to return data
        name: 
            Either one or a list of names for which to return stats. Can be a full name, partial
            name, or just first/last name, defaults to None.
        team: 
            The (list of) team(s) for which to return data, defaults to 'ALL'
        min_icetime: 
            A minimum icetime (in minutes) cut-off to apply, defaults to 0
        situation: 
            One of 'all', '5on5', '4on5', '5on4', or 'other', defaults to 'all'
        combine_seasons: 
            If True, and given multiple seasons, combine the results of each season into a single
            entry for each player, defaults to False
        quiet: 
            If set to True, don't print the data disclaimer, defaults to False

    Returns:

        A polars DataFrame containing all of the requested data.

    Raises:
    
        ValueError: An input of either incorrect value or type was provided.
