    """ Returns skater-level game-by-game statistics.

    Primary function for returning game-by-game skater statistics. Accepts one or multiple teams, 
    one or multiple skater names, one or multiple seasons, or alternatively, a start- and end-date
    for which to return game-by-game metrics.

    Args:

        season: 
            Either one or a list of seasons for which to return all games. Disregarded if both 
            start_date and end_date are also provided, defaults to None
        name: 
            Either one or a list of names for which to return stats. Can be a full name, partial
            name, or just first/last name. defaults to None.
        team: 
            Either one or a list of teams, provided in 3-letter acronyms, defaults to 'ALL'
        start_date: 
            A date from which to return all games on and after that date, in YYYY-MM-DD format,
            defaults to None
        end_date: 
            A date from which to return all games before and on that date, in YYYY-MM-DD format,
            defaults to None
        situation: 
            Either None (so return everything), or one of 'all', '5on5', '4on5', or '5on4',
            defaults to None
        quiet: 
            If set to True, don't print the data disclaimer, defaults to False

    Returns:

        A polars DataFrame containing all of the requested data.

    Raises:
    
        ValueError: An input of either incorrect value or type was provided.
