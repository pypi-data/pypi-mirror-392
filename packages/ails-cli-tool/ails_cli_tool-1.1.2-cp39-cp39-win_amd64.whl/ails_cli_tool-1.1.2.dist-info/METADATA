A powerful command-line tool that intelligently scans directories, analyzes project structures, and leverages AI to provide deep insights about your codebase. Perfect for developers who want to understand complex projects quickly or document their code automatically.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Leverages advanced language models to understand and describe your project structure
- **Smart Directory Scanning** - Efficiently scans and categorizes files with intelligent .gitignore support
- **Vector Search & Embeddings** - Advanced semantic search capabilities with SQLite vector database integration
- **Comment Extraction & Injection** - Extract and manage code comments across multiple programming languages
- **Git Operations** - AI automated commit message generation, git workflow integration, and smart diff copying:
  - Copy staged/unstaged changes diff to clipboard
  - Copy diff from any commit (with interactive history selection)
  - Copy all changes (staged + unstaged) with one click
- **Advanced Prompt Enhancement** - Multi-mode prompt optimization with context-aware file selection:
  - *Detailed Mode*: Generate comprehensive prompts with implementation suggestions
  - *Concise Mode*: Create minimal prompts letting AI decide implementation details
  - *Question Mode*: Answer user questions based on project context
  - *Concise Question Mode*: Get brief, direct answers with minimal explanation
  - *Diff Review Mode*: Professional code review for git changes with detailed analysis
  - *Concise Diff Review*: Quick review of git changes focusing on key issues
  - *Code Search Mode*: Find relevant code snippets based on user queries

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install AILS directly from PyPI:

```bash
uvx ails-cli-tool
```
### Update to latest version
```bash
uvx --force-reinstall ails-cli-tool
```

### First Run

1. **Start analyzing your projects**:
   ```bash
   ails
   ```

That's it! AILS will guide you through the rest.

## Detailed Installation

### PyPI (Recommended)

For stable releases:
```bash
uvx ails-cli-tool
```

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- uvx (included with uv)
- Internet connection for AI API calls

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

Run the configuration wizard to set up your AI API credentials:

```bash
ails-config
```

The wizard will guide you through:
1. Choosing between recommended configuration or manual setup
2. Entering your API credentials
3. Testing the connection
4. Saving the configuration securely

### Configuration Options

AILS requires three main settings:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `AI_API_KEY` | Your API key for the AI service | `sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `AI_API_URL` | Base URL for the API endpoint | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `AI_MODEL` | Model name to use | `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` |

### Recommended Configuration

AILS offers a **one-click recommended configuration** that:
-  Uses pre-configured, tested API settings
-  Automatically validates the connection
-  Gets you up and running in seconds

Simply select "Yes" when prompted during `ails-config`.

### Manual Configuration

For custom API providers or specific requirements:

1. Run `ails-config`
2. Choose manual configuration
3. Enter your specific:
   - API Key
   - API URL (must end in `/v1`)
   - Model name

### Configuration Storage

Configurations are stored securely in:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\AILS\config`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.config/ails/config`

This ensures your credentials are:
-  Separated from project files
-  Accessible across all projects
-  Easy to update or remove

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Scan and analyze your current directory:
```bash
ails
```

### Language Settings

Switch interface language using environment variables:

**English (default)**:
```bash
export AILS_LANG=en
ails
```

**Chinese**:
```bash
export AILS_LANG=zh
ails
```

**Windows users**:
```powershell
$env:AILS_LANG="zh"
ails
```

### Error Recovery

If AILS encounters an authentication error (401), it will:
1.  Detect the issue automatically
2.  Ask if you want to use recommended configuration
3. Retry immediately after successful configuration

No need to restart the program!

## Advanced Features

### Vector Search Integration

AILS includes semantic search capabilities using sqlite-vec:
- Find related code segments
- Discover similar functionality
- Navigate large codebases efficiently

### Smart File Filtering

Automatically respects:
- `.gitignore` patterns
- `.kilocodeignore` custom patterns
- Standard exclusion rules for common build artifacts

### Enhanced Prompts

AILS intelligently enhances prompts to:
- Add relevant context
- Include file metadata
- Optimize token usage

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Token Error (401)

**Symptom**: `Error code: 401 - invalid token`

**Solution**:
1. Select "Yes" when prompted to use recommended configuration
2. Or run `ails-config` manually
3. Verify your API key is correct and active

### Connection Timeout

**Symptom**: `API request timeout`

**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API URL is accessible
- Try using a different network or VPN if blocked

### Configuration Not Loading

**Symptom**: Program keeps asking for configuration

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify configuration file exists
# Windows:
type %APPDATA%\AILS\config

# macOS/Linux:
cat ~/.config/ails/config

# Re-run configuration wizard
ails-config
```

### Import Errors

**Symptom**: `ModuleNotFoundError`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall with all dependencies
uvx --force-reinstall ails-cli-tool
```
