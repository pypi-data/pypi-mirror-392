I am concerned about GitHub's Copilot project

I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org).

While I do not advocate for all the issues listed there I do not like that a company like Microsoft may profit from open source projects.

I continue to use GitHub because it offers the services I need for free.  But, I continue to monitor their terms of service.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.
