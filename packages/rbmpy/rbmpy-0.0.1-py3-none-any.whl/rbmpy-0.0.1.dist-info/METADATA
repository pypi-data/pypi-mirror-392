# RBM Analyses Package

Data analysis with the reduced Bayesian model (RBM).

### agent_rbm

The package contains a Python implementation of the RBM. The model can be used for simulations and for parameter
estimation. Examples coming soon. 

### circular_regression

It also contains code for custom regression models (currently circular) that can be combined with the RBM.
See "examples" folder for a minimal regression example.
