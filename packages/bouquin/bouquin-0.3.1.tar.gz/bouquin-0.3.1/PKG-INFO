# Bouquin


## Introduction

Bouquin ("Book-ahn") is a simple, opinionated notebook application written in Python, PyQt and SQLCipher.

It uses [SQLCipher bindings](https://pypi.org/project/sqlcipher3-wheels) as a drop-in replacement
for SQLite3. This means that the underlying database for the notebook is encrypted at rest.

To increase security, the SQLCipher key is requested when the app is opened, and is not written
to disk unless the user configures it to be in the settings.

There is deliberately no network connectivity or syncing intended.

## Features

 * Data is encrypted at rest
 * Encryption key is prompted for and never stored, unless user chooses to via Settings
 * Every 'page' is linked to the calendar day
 * All changes are version controlled, with ability to view/diff versions and revert
 * Text is Markdown with basic styling
 * Tabs are supported - right-click on a date from the calendar to open it in a new tab.
 * Images are supported
 * Search all pages, or find text on page (Ctrl+F)
 * Add tags to pages, find pages by tag in the Tag Browser, and customise tag names and colours
 * Automatic periodic saving (or explicitly save)
 * Transparent integrity checking of the database when it opens
 * Automatic locking of the app after a period of inactivity (default 15 min)
 * Rekey the database (change the password)
 * Export the database to json, html, csv, markdown or .sql (for sqlite3)
 * Backup the database to encrypted SQLCipher format (which can then be loaded back in to a Bouquin)
 * Dark and light themes
 * Automatically generate checkboxes when typing 'TODO'
 * It is possible to automatically move unchecked checkboxes from yesterday to today, on startup
 * English, French and Italian locales provided
