    The `InventoryReplenishment` class defines the abstract structure for inventory replenishment policies within 
    SupplyNetPy. It provides a common interface for managing how nodes place replenishment orders during the simulation.

    This class is not intended for direct use. It must be subclassed to implement specific replenishment strategies, 
    such as min-max (s, S), reorder point, quantity (RQ), or periodic review (TQ) policies.

    The `run` method should be overridden to define the replenishment logic for the policy. The class integrates with 
    the SimPy environment to support time-driven inventory management. The `inventory_drop` event is used to signal stock 
    depletion, enabling the replenishment process to respond to changes in inventory levels in real time.

    Parameters:

    The Inventory class models stock management within a node in the supply network. 
    It supports both perishable and non-perishable items, enforces capacity limits, 
    tracks on-hand levels, and notifies replenishment policy whenever inventory levels drops.
    For perishable inventories, it manages product shelf life and automatically removes expired items. 
    The class also records inventory levels and calculates carrying costs over time.

class Manufacturer(Node):
    """
    The Manufacturer class models a production unit in the supply network that consumes raw materials 
    to manufacture finished products. It maintains separate inventories for raw materials and finished goods, 
    applies replenishment policies to the product inventory, and places orders to suppliers dynamically.

    The manufacturer can be connected to multiple suppliers and automatically produces products based on 
    raw material availability. It continuously updates real-time statistics such as production volume, 
    manufacturing cost, and revenue.

    Parameters:
        env (simpy.Environment): Simulation environment.
        ID (str): Unique identifier for the manufacturer.

        inventory_holding_cost (float): Holding cost per unit for finished products.
        product_sell_price (float): Selling price per unit of the finished product.
        replenishment_policy (InventoryReplenishment): Replenishment policy object for the product inventory.
        policy_param (dict): Parameters for the replenishment policy.
        product (Product): Product manufactured by the manufacturer.
        inventory_type (str): Type of inventory ("non-perishable" or "perishable").
        shelf_life (float): Shelf life of the product.
        supplier_selection_policy (SupplierSelectionPolicy): Supplier selection policy class.
        supplier_selection_mode (str): Supplier selection mode (default is "fixed").

        replenishment_policy (InventoryReplenishment): Replenishment policy object for the product inventory.
        inventory (Inventory): Inventory object managing finished product stock.
        inventory_drop (simpy.Event): Event triggered when inventory drops.
        inventory_raised (simpy.Event): Event triggered when inventory is replenished.
        product (Product): Product manufactured by the manufacturer.
        suppliers (list): List of supplier links connected to this manufacturer.
        sell_price (float): Selling price per unit of the product.
        production_cycle (bool): Indicates whether the production cycle is currently active.
        raw_inventory_counts (dict): Inventory levels of raw materials by raw material ID.

        ongoing_order (bool): Indicates whether a product order is currently in progress.
        selection_policy (SupplierSelectionPolicy): Supplier selection policy object.
        stats (Statistics): Statistics tracking object for the manufacturer.

    Functions:
        __init__: Initializes the Manufacturer object.
        manufacture_product: Manufactures the product by consuming raw materials and updating product inventory.
        behavior: Main behavior loop that checks inventory and triggers production if raw materials are available.
        process_order: Places an order for raw materials based on the quantity of products to be manufactured.
        process_order_raw: Places an individual order for a specific raw material from a supplier.

    Behavior:
        The manufacturer continuously monitors raw material inventory levels and initiates production when raw materials 
        are available. Finished products are added to the inventory upon completion of a manufacturing cycle. If raw 
        materials are insufficient, the manufacturer places replenishment orders with connected suppliers.

    Assumptions:
        The manufacturer produces only a single type of product.
        Separate inventories are maintained for raw materials and finished products.
        Only the finished product inventory is actively monitored by the replenishment policy.
        Raw material inventories are replenished based on product inventory requirements.
        The raw material inventory is initially empty.

class Demand(Node):
    """
    The `Demand` class represents a demand node that generates product orders within the supply network. 
    It models dynamic demand patterns using user-defined functions for order arrival times and order quantities, and manages 
    customer tolerance for waiting in case of product unavailability.
    The demand node automatically places customer orders at configurable intervals and can handle situations where the requested 
    quantity is not immediately available. Customers can either wait (if tolerance is set) or leave the system unfulfilled.

    The class supports: 
    
    - Customizable lead time and delivery cost per order, 
    
    - Dynamic order splitting based on the minimum split ratio, 
    
    - Backorder management and real-time inventory check.

    Parameters:
        env (simpy.Environment): Simulation environment.
        ID (str): Unique identifier for the demand node.
        name (str): Name of the demand node.
        order_arrival_model (callable): Function that models inter-arrival times between customer orders.
        order_quantity_model (callable): Function that models the quantity per customer order.
        demand_node (Node): Upstream node from which the demand node sources products.
        tolerance (float): Maximum time customers are willing to wait if required quantity is unavailable.
        order_min_split_ratio (float): Minimum allowable fraction of the order that can be delivered in split deliveries.
        delivery_cost (callable): Function that models the delivery cost per order.
        lead_time (callable): Function that models the delivery lead time per order.
        consume_available (bool): If True, the demand node consumes available inventory immediately and leaves.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for Node and GlobalLogger.

    Attributes:
        _info_keys (list): List of keys to include in the info dictionary.
        order_arrival_model (callable): Function defining the order arrival process.
        order_quantity_model (callable): Function defining the order quantity distribution.
        demand_node (Node): Upstream node supplying the demand.
        customer_tolerance (float): Maximum waiting time allowed for customer orders.
        delivery_cost (callable): Delivery cost function for each order.
        lead_time (callable): Delivery lead time function for each order.
        min_split (float): Minimum allowed split ratio for partially fulfilled orders.
        consume_available (bool): If True, partial fulfillment is allowed and available inventory is consumed immediately.
        stats (Statistics): Tracks various performance metrics like demand placed, fulfilled, and shortages.

    Functions:
        __init__: Initializes the demand node object and validates input models.
        _process_delivery: Handles the delivery process, including lead time and delivery cost updates.
        wait_for_order: Waits for required units based on customer tolerance when immediate fulfillment is not possible.
        customer: Simulates customer order placement and fulfillment behavior.
        behavior: Generates continuous customer demand based on the arrival and quantity models.
    
    Behavior:
        The demand node generates customer orders at random intervals and quantities using the specified arrival 
        and quantity models. If the upstream inventory can satisfy the order, delivery is processed immediately. 
        If not, 
        
        - the customer may leave immediately (if tolerance is zero)

        - else, the customer waits for the order to be fulfilled within their tolerance time, possibly accepting
        partial deliveries if a split ratio is allowed. If the tolerance is exceeded, the unmet demand is recorded as a shortage.

    Assumptions:
        - Customer orders arrive following the provided stochastic arrival model.
        - Order quantities follow the specified stochastic quantity model.
        - Customers may wait for the fulfillment of their orders up to the defined tolerance time.
        - Customers can accept split deliveries based on the minimum split ratio.
        - If customer tolerance is zero, customer returns without waiting for fulfillment.
        - Delivery cost and lead time are sampled dynamically for each order (if specified).
        - The connected upstream node must not be a supplier; it should typically be a retailer or distributor node.
