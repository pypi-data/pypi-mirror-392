# Estimating Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

## System Description

As Best Buy sells its current inventory of HP computers, the purchasing manager places a  replenishment order for a new lot of Q computers. Including the cost of transportation, Best Buy incurs a fixed cost of $S per order. The purchasing manager must decide on the number of computers to order from HP in a lot. For this decision, we assume the following inputs:

 - D Annual demand of the product
 - S Fixed cost incurred per order
 - C Cost per unit
 - h Holding cost per year as a fraction of product cost
 
 Assume that HP does not offer any discounts, and each unit costs $C no matter how large an order is. The holding cost is thus given by H = hC. The model is developed using the following basic assumptions:

 1. Demand is steady at D units per unit time.
 2. No shortages are allowed, that is, all demand must be supplied from stock.
 3. Replenishment lead time is fixed (initially assumed to be zero).

The purchasing manager makes the lot-sizing decision to minimize the total cost the store incurs. He or she must consider three costs when deciding on the lot size:

 - Annual material cost
 - Annual ordering cost
 - Annual holding cost

 Because purchase price is independent of lot size, we have

  - Annual material cost = $CD$
 
 The number of orders must suffice to meet the annual demand D. Given a lot size of Q, we thus have

  - Number of orders per year = $\frac{D}{Q}$
 
 Because an order cost of S is incurred for each order placed, we infer that

  - Annual ordering cost = $(\frac{D}{Q}){S}$
 
Given a lot size of Q, we have an average inventory of Q/2. The annual holding cost is thus the cost of holding Q/2 units in inventory for one year and is given as

  - Annual holding cost = $(\frac{Q}{2})H = (\frac{Q}{2})hC$

The total annual cost, TC, is the sum of all three costs and is given as

  - Total annual cost, $TC = CD + (\frac{D}{Q})S + (\frac{Q}{2})hC$

Above figure shows the variation in different costs as the lot size is changed. Observe that  the annual holding cost increases with an increase in lot size. In contrast, the annual ordering cost declines with an increase in lot size. The material cost is independent of lot size because we have assumed the price to be fixed. The total annual cost thus first declines and then increases with an increase in lot size.

From the perspective of the manager at Best Buy, the optimal lot size is one that minimizes the total cost to Best Buy. It is obtained by taking the first derivative of the total cost with respect to Q and setting it equal to 0. The optimum lot size is referred to as the economic order quantity (EOQ). It is denoted by Q* and is given by the following equation:

Optimal lot size, $Q* = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{hC}}$
 
## Numerical Example

Demand for the Deskpro computer at Best Buy is 1,000 units per month. Best Buy incurs a fixed order placement, transportation, and receiving cost of $4,000 each time an order is placed. Each computer costs Best Buy $500 and the retailer has a holding cost of 20 percent. Evaluate the number of computers that the store manager should order in each replenishment lot.

Analysis:
In this case, the store manager has the following inputs:

 - Annual demand, $D = 1,000 * 12 = 12,000$ units
 - Order cost per lot, $S = 4,000$
 - Unit cost per computer, $C = 500$
 - Holding cost per year as a fraction of unit cost, $h = 0.2$
 
Using the EOQ formula, the optimal lot size is<br>

Optimal order size = Q* =  $\sqrt{\frac{2 * 12,000 * 4,000}{0.2 * 500}} = 980$
 
To minimize the total cost at Best Buy, the store manager orders a lot size of 980 computers for each replenishment order. The cycle inventory is the average resulting inventory and is given by<br>

Cycle inventory = $\frac{Q*}{2} = 490$
 
For a lot size of Q* = 980, the store manager evaluates<br>

Number of orders per year = $\frac{D} {Q*} = \frac{12,000} {980} = 12.24$<br>
Annual ordering and holding cost = $\frac{D} {Q*} S + (\frac{Q*} {2}) hC = 97,980$<br>
Average flow time = $\frac{Q*} {2D} = \frac{490} {12,000} = 0.041$ year $= 0.49$ month

Each computer thus spends 0.49 month, on average, at Best Buy before it is sold because it was purchased in a batch of 980.

"""
 Demand for the Deskpro computer at Best Buy is 1,000 units per month. Best Buy incurs a fixed order placement, 
 transportation, and receiving cost of $4,000 each time an order is placed. Each computer costs Best Buy $500 
 and the retailer has a holding cost of 20 percent. Evaluate the number of computers that the store manager 
 should order in each replenishment lot.
 
 Analysis:
 In this case, the store manager has the following inputs:
 - Annual demand, D = 1,000 * 12 = 12,000 units (approx 34 units per day)
 - Order cost per lot, S = 4,000 
 - Unit cost per computer, C = 500
 - Holding cost per year as a fraction of unit cost, h = 0.2 (500*0.2 = 100 per year => 100/365 = 0.273 per day)

 Assumptions:
 - Demand is constant and deterministic
 - Lead time is zero

Optimum Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is determined to minimize the total cost.
Total cost = Annual material cost + Annual ordering cost + Annual holding cost
This is same as -> Total cost = total transportation cost + inventory cost (we'll ignore material cost since it is constant)

## Results

![estimated EOQ](img/EOQ_est_files/EOQ_est_1_1.png)

We conducted multiple simulations with varying lengths (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000). Our findings indicated that when the simulation length is less than 4000, the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is approximately 1010. Additionally, we found that the results improve as the simulation length increases.
