# fastAppear

fastAppear is a small FastAPI project that provides a starting template for building REST APIs with async SQLModel + SQLAlchemy, JWT-based authentication, and a clean project layout.

This repository includes:
- FastAPI application with a simple lifespan handler and middleware
- Async database helper utilities using SQLAlchemy async engine + SQLModel
- Simple logger with colored console output
- Sample auth endpoints (placeholders), a health endpoint, and a documented OpenAPI UI

## Features
- FastAPI app with startup/shutdown lifecycle handling
- Async DB setup (SQLAlchemy async + SQLModel)
- JWT configuration via environment variables
- CORS middleware and request timing middleware
- Ready-to-extend router placeholders for auth

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or newer
- (Optional) Poetry for dependency management or use pip with a virtualenv

### Installation (recommended: Poetry)
```zsh
uv sync
```

### Environment variables (.env)
Copy the example `.env` file and fill values for your environment. Example variables used by the app:

- DB_URI (required): Database connection string, e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/fastappear_db` or `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dev.db`
- ROOT_PATH (optional): App root path — used if deploying behind a reverse proxy
- LOGGING_LEVEL: `DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARNING`/`ERROR`/`CRITICAL`
- JWT_SECRET_KEY (required): A secure secret for JWT signing.
- JWT_ALGORITHM: default `HS512`
- JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: default `720`
- JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS: default `7`

Tip: You can generate a secure secret via Python `secrets.token_urlsafe(64)`:
```zsh
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
```

---

## Running the app
There are two common ways to run the app locally.

```zsh
gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -c gunicorn_conf.py src.main:app
```

Open the following URLs:
- API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- Health: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

---

## Testing
Run the tests with pytest:
```zsh
pytest -q
```

Note: The repository includes `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio`. If you plan to test DB integration, configure a test DB and pass DB_URI in your environment.

---

## Project structure
Key files and folders:
- `src/main.py` — FastAPI app entry point (lifespan, middleware, router configuration)
- `src/config.py` — Pydantic-based settings and `.env` config
- `src/utils/db.py` — Async DB engine, session factory, and init helpers
- `src/utils/logger.py` — Configured logger with colored output
- `src/static_values/` — (optional) constant/value definitions used across the app
- `test/` — tests for the project

---

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. A few suggestions:
- Open a GitHub issue if you'd like to propose a significant change
- For small fixes or features, submit a PR against `main`
- Implement features in small, reviewable changes and include tests

Developer tips:
- The `scripts/` directory contains helper scripts to scaffold modules and tests.
- The `dev_docs/commands.md` file has commands and run/debug tips for development.

---

## Notes & TODOs
- The repository contains placeholders for auth routers and a placeholder `create_default_admin_if_missing` function. Replace these with your production logic and migrations as needed.
- For any production deployment, avoid storing secrets in `.env` files and use a secrets manager instead (AWS Secrets Manager, Hashicorp Vault, etc.).
