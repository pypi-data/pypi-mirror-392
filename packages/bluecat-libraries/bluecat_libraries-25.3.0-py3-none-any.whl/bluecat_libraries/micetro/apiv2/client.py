class Client(HTTPClient):
    """
     A client for making HTTP calls to Micetro REST API.

     There is a method for each HTTP verb - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE -
     as well as a generic method for a HTTP request: http_get, http_post,
     http_put, http_patch, http_delete, and http_request. The functionality of
     the client relies on the use of these methods.

     The benefits of this client over a direct use of the ``requests`` Python
     library are:

         1.  Available methods for performing authentication.
         2.  The client keeps track of the authentication token and automatically
             sends it with each request.
         3.  The client keeps track of the base API URL, needing only the
             relative path to be specified when making a request.
         4.  The client automatically parses the responses and returns Python
             data structures - dictionaries or strings - based on the response
             content type.
         5.  The client detects error responses and raises a Python exception,
             which holds the fields that the Micetro API replied with, e.g, code.

     Overall, users of the client can write less code and keep track of less data
     when making requests to the Micetro REST API.

     Nonetheless, the client allows for taking advantage of the full
     functionality of the Micetro REST API by exposing all available ``requests``
     parameters in its methods. That way a user can, for example, specify filters
     and fields selection through URL query parameters.

    You need to authenticate to the Micetro REST API via the client method (with a username
     and a password) when making calls. The client will use HTTP header ``Authorization`` as per the
     Micetro documentation.

     .. note:: The client does not specify a value for the `Accept` header by
         default. This results in the `Content-Type` of the response to be
         determined by the defaults of Micetro.

     Example:

     .. code-block:: python

         from bluecat_libraries.micetro.apiv2 import Client, MediaType

         # Retrieve the users. Request the data as per Micetro's default content type.
         with Client(<micetro_url>) as client:
             client.authenticate(<username>, <password>)
             response = client.http_get("/users")
             users = response["result"]["users"]
             for user in users:
                 print(f'{user["ref"]}: {user["name"]}')

         # Retrieve the users. Request that the response is in 'XML' format.
         with Client(<micetro_url>) as client:
             client.authenticate(<username>, <password>)
             response = client.http_get(
                 "/users",
                 headers={"Accept": MediaType.XML},
             )
             print(response)
