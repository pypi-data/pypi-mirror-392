class Client(HTTPClient):
    """
    A client for making HTTP calls to BAM REST v2 API.

    There is a method for each HTTP verb - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE -
    as well as a generic method for a HTTP request: http_get, http_post,
    http_put, http_patch, http_delete, and http_request. The functionality of
    the client relies on the use of these methods.

    The benefits of this client over a direct use of the ``requests`` Python
    library are:

        1.  Available methods for performing login and logout, as well as
            determining the version of the BlueCat Address Manager.
        2.  The client keeps track of the authentication token and automatically
            sends it with each request.
        3.  The client keeps track of the base API URL, needing only the
            relative path to be specified when making a request.
        4.  The client automatically parses the responses and returns Python
            data structures - dictionaries or strings - based on the response
            content type.
        5.  The client detects error responses and raises a Python exception,
            which holds the fields that the BAM API replied with, e.g, code.

    Overall, users of the client can write less code and keep track of less data
    when making requests to the BAM REST v2 API.

    Nonetheless, the client allows for taking advantage of the full
    functionality of the BAM REST v2 API by exposing all available ``requests``
    parameters in its methods. That way a user can, for example, specify filters
    and fields selection through URL query parameters.

    You need to authenticate to the BAM REST v2 API when making calls. The
    client will use HTTP header ``Authorization`` as per the BAM documentation.
    You have to either perform a login via the client method (with a username
    and a password) or set the ``auth`` property to the full value for the
    header, including the authorization scheme.

    .. note:: The client does not specify a value for the `Accept` header by
        default. This results in the `Content-Type` of the response to be
        determined by the defaults of BAM.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from bluecat_libraries.address_manager.apiv2 import Client, MediaType
        import csv

        # Retrieve the configurations. Request the data as per BAM's default content type.
        with Client(<bam_host_url>) as client:
            client.login(<username>, <password>)
            response = client.http_get("/configurations")
            configurations = response["data"]
            for configuration in configurations:
                print(f'{configuration["id"]}: {configuration["name"]}')
            client.logout()

        # Retrieve the configurations. Request that the response is in 'JSON' format.
        # The result should contain only fields 'id' and 'name'.
        with Client(<bam_host_url>) as client:
            client.login(<username>, <password>)
            response = client.http_get(
                "/configurations",
                params={"fields": "id,name"},
                headers={"Accept": MediaType.JSON},
            )
            configurations = response["data"]
            for configuration in configurations:
                print(f'{configuration["id"]}: {configuration["name"]}')
            client.logout()

        # Retrieve configurations. Request that the response is in 'CSV' format.
        # The result should contain only the first 10, ordered alphabetically by name.
