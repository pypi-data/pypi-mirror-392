    A client for calling the Failover API of Address Manager.

    The Failover API is a service configuration in Address Manager that can
    enable an externally automated failover when the primary Address Manager
    fails.

    :param url: The base URL of BAM's Failover service. For security reasons,
        the Failover Client always use HTTPS, even if the URL specifies an HTTP scheme.
        If no port is specified within the URL, the client will use port 8444.
    :param cert: Path to an SSL client certificate. The first item being the path to the certificate file
        and the second item is the key.
    :param verify: Whether to verify the server's TLS certificate. If a
        string is passed, it is treated as a path to a CA bundle to
        use. Defaults to ``True``.
