CFN-Check is a small, fast, friendly tool for validating AWS CloudFormation YAML templates. It is code-driven, with 
rules written as simple, `Rule` decorator wrapped python class methods for `Collection`-inheriting classes.

<br/>

# Why CFN-Check?

AWS has its own tools for validating Cloud Formation - `cfn-lint` and `cfn-guard`. `cfn-check` aims to solve
problems inherint to `cfn-lint` more than `cfn-guard`, primarily:

- Confusing, unclear syntax around rules configuration
- Inability to parse non-resource wildcards
- Inability to validate non-resource template data
- Inabillity to use structured models to validate input
- Poor ability to parse and render CloudFormation Refs/Functions

In comparison to `cfn-guard`, `cfn-check` is pure Python, thus
avoiding YADSL (Yet Another DSL) headaches. It also proves
significantly more configurable/modular/hackable as a result.
`cfn-check` can resolve _some_ (not all) CloudFormation Intrinsic
Functions and Refs.

CFN-Check uses a combination of simple depth-first-search tree
parsing, friendly `cfn-lint` like query syntax, `Pydantic` models,
and `pytest`-like assert-driven checks to make validating your
Cloud Formation easy while offering both CLI and Python API interfaces.
CFN-Check also uses a lightning-fast AST-parser to render your templates,
allowing you to validate policy, not just a YAML document.

<br/>

# Getting Started

`cfn-check` requires:

- `Python 3.12`
- Any number of valid CloudFormation templates or a path to said templates.
- A `.py` file containing at least one `Collection` class with at least one valid `@Rule()` decorated method

To get started (we recommend using `uv`), run:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install cfn-check

touch rules.py
touch template.yaml
```

Next open the `rules.py` file and create a basic Python class
as below.

```python
from cfn_check import Collection, Rule


class ValidateResourceType(Collection):

    @Rule(
        "Resources::*::Type",
        "It checks Resource::Type is correctly definined",
    )
    def validate_test(self, value: str): 
        assert value is not None, '❌ Resource Type not defined'
        assert isinstance(value, str), '❌ Resource Type not a string'
```

This provides us a basic rule set that validates that the `Type` field of our CloudFormation template(s) exists and is the correct data type.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't worry about adding an `__init__()` method to this class!

Next open the `template.yaml` file and paste the following CloudFormation:

```yaml

  AllSecurityGroups:
    Description: Security Groups that are associated with the EC2 instance
    Value: !Join

```

This represents a basic configuration for an AWS Lambda function.

Finally, run:

```bash
cfn-check validate -r rules.py template.yaml
```

which outputs:

```

Congrats! You've just made the cloud a bit better place!

# Queries, Tokens, and Syntax

A `cfn-check` Query is a string made up of period (`.`) delimited "Tokens" centered around four primary types:

- <b>`Keys`</b>  - `<KEY>`: String name key Tokens that perform exact matching on keys of key/value pairs in a CloudFormation document.
- <b>`Values`</b> - `(<KEY> = <VALUE>)`:  Parenthesis-enclosed `K==V` pairs that perform matching on values of key/value pairs in a CloudFormation document.
- <b>`Patterns`</b>  - `<\d+>`: Arrow-enclosed regex pattern Tokens that perform pattern-based matching on keys of key/value pairs in a CloudFormation document.
- <b>`Ranges`</b> - `[]`: Brackets enclosed Tokens that perform array selection and filtering in a CloudFormation document.


In addition to `Key`, `Value`, `Pattern`, and `Range` selection, you can also incorporate:

- <b>`Bounded Ranges`</b> - `[<A>-<B>]`: Exact matches from the starting position (if specified) to the end position (if specified) of an array
- <b>`Indicies`</b> - `[<A>]`: Exact matches the specified indicies of an array
- <b>`Key Ranges`</b> - `[<KEY>]`: Exact matches keys of objects within an array
- <b>`Pattern Ranges`</b> (`[<\d+>]`): Matches they keys of objects within an array based on the specified pattern
- <b>`Wildcards`</b> (`*`): Selects all values for a given object or array or returns the non-object/array value at the specified path
- <b>`Wildcard Ranges`</b> (`[*]`): Selects all values for a given array and ensures that *only* the values of a valid array type are returned (any other type will be treated as a mismatch).

### Working with Keys

Keys likely the most commos Token type you'll use in your queries. In fact, if you ran the example above, you already have! For example, with:

```
Resources
```

as your query, you'll select all items within the CloudFormation document under the `Resources` key.


### Working with Values

In addition to searching by keys, filtering by the values associated with those keys is the most common way you'll traverse and validate your CloudFormation template. To filter `Resource` key matches by the value of their `Type` value to only return EC2 Instances, we would specify a query like:

```
Resources.*.(Type == AWS::EC2::Instance)
```

You can also match multiple values by utilizing the `in`/`IN` operator:

```
Resources.*.(Type in AWS::Lambda::Function,AWS::Serverless::Function)
```

and providing a comma-delimited list of values.

> [!NOTE]
> Value queries do not support Nested Ranges or nested queries, but *do* support
> Wildcards and Patterns. See below for more info!

### Working with Patterns

If an object within a CloudFormation document contains multiple similar keys you want to select, `Pattern` Tokens are your go-to solution. Consider this segment of CloudFormation:

```yaml
Resources:
  SecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Allow HTTP traffic to the host
      VpcId: !Ref ExistingVPC
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 80
          ToPort: 80
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
      SecurityGroupEgress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 80
          ToPort: 80
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```

We want to select <i>both</i> `SecurityGroupIngress` and `SecurityGroupEgress` to perform the same rule evaluations. Since the keys for both blocks start with `SecurityGroup`, we could write a Query using a Pattern Token like:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.<SecurityGroup>
```

which would allow us to use a single rule to evaluate both:

```python
class ValidateSecurityGroups(Collection):

    @Rule(
        "Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.<SecurityGroup>",
        "It checks Security Groups are correctly definined",
    )
    def validate_security_groups(self, value: list[dict]):
      assert len(value) > 0
      
      for item in value:
        protocol = item.get("IpProtocol")
        assert isinstance(protocol, str)
        assert protocol == "tcp"
    
        from_port = item.get("FromPort")
        assert isinstance(from_port, int)
        assert from_port == 80

        to_port = item.get('ToPort')
        assert isinstance(to_port, int)
        assert to_port == 80

        cidr_ip = item.get('CidrIp')
        assert isinstance(cidr_ip, str)
        assert cidr_ip == '0.0.0.0/0'
```

### Working with Wildcards

Wildcard Tokens allow you to select all matching objects, array entries, or values (given preceding tokens) within a CloudFormation document. Wildcard Tokens are powerful, allowing you to effectively destructure objects into their respective keys and values or arrays into their entries for easier filtering and checking.

In fact, you've already used one! In the first example, we use a Wildcard Token in the below query:

```
Resources.*.Type
```

To select all `Resource` objects, then further extract the `Type` field from each object. This helps us avoid copy-paste rules at the potential cost of deferring more work to individual `Rule` methods if we aren't careful and select too much!

### Working with Ranges

Ranges allow you to perform sophisticated selection of objects or data within a CloudFormation document.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Range Tokens *only* work on arrays. This means that any
> values or other objects/data in the selected section of the
> CloudFormation document will be *ignored* and filtered out.

#### Unbounded Ranges

Unbounded ranges allow you to select and return an array in its entirety. For example:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[]
```

Would return all SecurityGroupIngress objects in the CloudFormation document as a list, allowing you to check that the array of ingresses has been both defined *and* populated.


#### Indexes

Indexes allow you to select specific positions within an array. For example:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[0]
```

Would return the first SecurityGroupIngress objects in the document.


#### Bounded Ranges

Bounded Ranges allow you to select subsets of indicies within an array (much like Python slicing). Unlike Python slicing, Bounded Ranges do *not* allow you to select a "step", however like Python slicing, starting positions are inclusive and end positions are exclusive (i.e. `0-10` will select from indexes `0` to `9`)


As an example:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[1-3]
```

Would select the second and third SecurityGroupIngress objects in the document.

Start or end positions are optional for Bounded Ranges. If a starting position is not defined, `cfn-check` will default to `0`. Likewise, if an end position is not defined, `cfn-check` will default to the end of given list. For example:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[-3]
```

selects the first through third SecurityGroupIngress objects in the document while:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[3-]
```

selects the remaining SecurityGroupIngress objects starting from the third.


#### Key Ranges

Often times it's easier to match based upon an array's contents than by exact index. Key Ranges allow you to do this by matching the contents of each item in an array by:

- Exact match value comparison if the array value is not an object or array
- Single exact match value comparison if the array value is an array (i.e. there is at least one value exactly matching the Token in the array)
- Single exact match key comparison if the array value is an object

For example:

```
Resources.MyEC2Instance.Properties.ImageId.[AWSRegionArch2AMI]
```

returns only the EC2 ImageIds where the ImageId exactly matches `AWSRegionArch2AMI`.


#### Pattern Ranges

Pattern Ranges function much like Key Ranges, but utilize regex-based pattern matching for comparison. Adapting the above example:

```
Resources.MyEC2Instance.Properties.ImageId.[<^AWSRegion>]
```

returns only the EC2 ImageIds where the ImageId begins with `AWSRegion`. This can be helpful in checking for and enforcing naming standards, etc.


#### Wildcard Ranges

Wildcard Ranges extend the powerful functionality of Wildcard Tokens with the added safety of ensuring *only* arrays selected for further filtering or checks. 

For example we know:

```
Resources.*.Type
```

Selects all `Resource` objects. If we convert the Wildcard Token in the query to a Wildcard Range Token:

```
Resources.[*].Type
```

The Rule will fail as below:

```
error: ❌ No results matching results for query Resources::[*]::Type
```

as we're selecting objects, not an array! A valid use would be in validating the deeply nested zipfile code of a Lambda's `AppendItemToListFunction`:

```yaml
  AppendItemToListFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
      Code:
        ZipFile: !Join
          - ''
          - - var response = require('cfn-response');
            - exports.handler = function(event, context) {
            - '   var responseData = {Value: event.ResourceProperties.List};'
            - '   responseData.Value.push(event.ResourceProperties.AppendedItem);'
            - '   response.send(event, context, response.SUCCESS, responseData);'
            - '};'
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
```

Note that the array we want is nested within another array, and we need to make sure we don't select the empty string that is the first element of the outer array!

We can accomplish this by using a Wildcard Range Token in our Query as below:

```
Resources.AppendItemToListFunction.Properties.Code.ZipFile.[*].[]
```

Which allows us to then evaluate the Unbounded Range token against each array item, returning only the array we want.

### Using Multiple Tokens in Ranges

You can use multiple Tokens within a Range Token by seperating each token with a comma.

> [!NOTE]
> While YAML does allow commas in keys, CloudFormation does not.
> As such, the case where a Pattern or Pattern Range might
> contain a comma is non-existent.

For example:

```
Resources.SecurityGroup.Properties.SecurityGroupIngress.[0, -2]
```

Would select all except the last element of an array.

This also applies to Bounded Ranges, Key Ranges, Pattern Ranges, and Wildcard Ranges! For example:

```
Resources.MyEC2Instance.Properties.ImageId.[(^AWSRegion),(^),(^Custom)]
```

will select any EC2 ImageIds that start with either `AWSRegion` or `Custom`.


### Nested Ranges

CloudFormation often involes nested arrays, and navigating these can make for long and difficult-to-read Queries. To help reduce Query length, `cfn-check` supports nesting Range Tokens. For example, when evaluating:

```yaml
ZipFile: !Join
  - ''
  - - var response = require('cfn-response');
    - exports.handler = function(event, context) {
    - '   var responseData = {Value: event.ResourceProperties.List};'
    - '   responseData.Value.push(event.ResourceProperties.AppendedItem);'
    - '   response.send(event, context, response.SUCCESS, responseData);'
    - '};'
```

from our previous examples, we used the below query to select the nested array:

```
Resources.AppendItemToListFunction.Properties.Code.ZipFile.[*].[]
```

With Nested Ranges, this can be shortened to:

```
Resources.AppendItemToListFunction.Properties.Code.ZipFile.[[]]
```

Which is both more concise *and* more representitave of our intention to select only the array.

# Grouping Queries

CFN-Check grouping allows you significant freedom of expression in how you write queries while *also* allowing you to more easily restrict and filter results by multiple criterion. Queries support both logical "or" and "and" statements via the `|` and `&` operators respectively. For example, consider the previous values query where we used an `in` operator:

```
Resources.*.(Type in AWS::Lambda::Function,AWS::Serverless::Function)
```

This could be rewritten as:
```
Resources.*(Type == AWS::Lambda::Function | Type == AWS::Serverless::Function)
```

A more likely scenario might be finding specifically NodeJS Lambda functions. For example:

```
Resources.*.(Type == AWS::Lambda::Function,AWS::Serverless::Function & Properties.Runtime == <nodejs20>)
```

Queries are "split" by `|` operator and then "grouped" by `&` operator. That means if we want a query to match one set of criterion <i>or</i> another we could write:

```
Resources.*.(Type == AWS::Lambda::Function & Properties.Runtime == <nodejs20> | Type == AWS::Serverless::Function & Properties.Runtime == <nodejs20>)
```

<br/>

# Using Pydantic Models

In addition to traditional `pytest`-like assert statements, `cfn-lint` can validate results returned by queries via `Pydantic` models.

For example, consider again the initial example where we validate the `Type` field of `Resource` objects.

```python
from cfn_check import Collection, Rule


class ValidateResourceType(Collection):

    @Rule(
        "Resources.*.Type",
        "It checks Resource.Type is correctly definined",
    )
    def validate_test(self, value: str): 
        assert value is not None, '❌ Resource Type not defined'
        assert isinstance(value, str), '❌ Resource Type not a string'
```

Rather than explicitly querying for the type field and writing assertions, we can instead define a `Pydantic` schema, then pass all `Resource` objects to that schema by specifying it as a Python type hint in our `Rule` method's signature.

```python
from cfn_check import Collection, Rule
from pydantic import BaseModel, StrictStr

class Resource(BaseModel):
    Type: StrictStr


class ValidateResourceType(Collection):

    @Rule(
        "Resources.*",
        "It checks Resource.Type is correctly definined",
    )
    def validate_test(self, value: Resource):
        assert value is not None
```

By deferring type and existence assertions to `Pydantic` models, you can focus your actual assertion logic on business/security policy checks.

<br/>

# Using .query()

Some of the most challenging validations to write in CFN-Guard or CFN-Lint are those requring validation of other template information against an existing selection. For example, validating that a Lambda has a LoggingGroup attached and specified within the same template.

CFN-Check makes performing these complex assertions intuitive and painless by allowing you to execute additional querieis within a rule via the `.query()` method. For example, to perform the LoggingGroup validation above you might write:

```python
@Rule("Resources.*.(Type in AWS::Lambda::Function,AWS::Serverless::Function)", "It validates a lambda is configured correctly")
def validate_lambda(self, lambda_resource: Lambda):
    assert isinstance(lambda_resource, Lambda), "Not a valid Lambda"
    
    log_groups = self.query(
        f"Resources.{lambda_resource.Properties.LoggingConfig.LogGroup}",
        transforms=[
            lambda data: LoggingGroup(**data)
        ]
    )

    assert log_groups is not None, f"No resources found for LoggingGroup {lambda_resource.Properties.LoggingConfig.LogGroup}"
    assert len(log_groups) > 0, "No matching logging group found in Resources for Lambda"
```       

The  `query()` method accepts the following parameters:

- `query - (str, required)`: A string CFN-Check query as used when defining Rules.
- `document - (dict/list/any, optional)`: The filepath to a CloudFormation template document. This document must have been loaded by and specified to CFN-Check either via the default CLI path param, the `-i/--import-values` optional CLI arg, or under the `input_values` config key. This will cause the query specified in the call to execute against the template specified.
- `transforms - (list[Function], optional)`: A list of functions that can be used to modify and filter returned results. In the example above, we use a single transform function to convert matches returned to a `LoggingGroup` Pydantic model instance.

# The Rendering Engine

### Overview

In Version 0.6.X, CFN-Check introduced a rendering engine, which allows it
to parse and execute Refs and all CloudFormation intrinsic functions via 
either the CloudFormation document or user-supplied values. This additional
also resulted in the:

```bash
cfn-check render <TEMPLATE_PATH >
```

command being added, allowing you to effectively "dry run" render your
CloudFormation templates akin to the `helm template` command for Helm.

By default, `cfn-check render` outputs to stdout, however you can easily
save rendered output to a file via the `-o/--output-file` flag. For example:

```bash
cfn-check render template.yml -o rendered.yml
```

The `cfn-check render` command also offers the following options:

- `-a/--attributes`:  A list of <key>=<value> input `!GetAtt` attributes to use
- `-m/--mappings`: A list of <key>=<value> input `Mappings` to use
- `-p/--parameters`: A list of <key>=<value> input `Parameters` to use
- `-l/--log-level`: The log level to use

### The Rendering Engine during Checks

By default rendering is enabled when running `cfn-check` validation. You can 
disable it by supplying `no-render` to the `-F/--flags` option as below:

```bash
cfn-check validate -F no-render -r rules.py template.yaml
```

Disabling rendering means CFN-Check will validate your template as-is, with
no additional pre-processing and no application of user input values.

> [!WARNING]
> CloudFormation documents are <b>not</b> "plain yaml" and disabling
> rendering means any dynamically determined values will likely fail
> to pass validation, resulting in false positives for failures!
