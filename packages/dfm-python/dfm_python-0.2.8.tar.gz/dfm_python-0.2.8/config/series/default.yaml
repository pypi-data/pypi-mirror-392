#   - frequency: 'm' (monthly), 'q' (quarterly), 'sa' (semi-annual), 'a' (annual)
#   - transformation: 'lin' (levels), 'pch' (percent change), 'pca' (percent change annualized), etc.
#   - category: Category/group name
#   - units: Units of measurement
#   - blocks: List of block names this series loads on (must include Block_Global)
#
# To add/modify series:
