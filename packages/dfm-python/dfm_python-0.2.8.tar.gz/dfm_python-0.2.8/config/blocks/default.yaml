# DFM Block Structure Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Each block corresponds to a set of series defined in config/series/default.yaml
# and represents one latent factor (or more) capturing that sector's dynamics.
#
# Each block has:
#   - factors: number of latent factors in this block
#              **IMPORTANT**: This should be determined based on:
#              * Number of series in the block (more series may need more factors)
#              * Complexity of the sector (simple sectors: 1, complex: 2-3)
#              * Model fit diagnostics (check factor loadings and explained variance)
#              * Typical range: 1-3 factors per block
#              * Start with 1 and increase if model fit is poor
#   - ar_lag: autoregressive lag order for the block-level factor (typically 1)
#   - clock: optional, if block frequency differs from global clock
#   - notes: optional comments
#
# **How to determine factors per block:**
#   1. Start with factors: 1 for each block (simplest model)
#   2. Check model diagnostics: factor loadings, explained variance per series
#   3. If many series in a block have low loadings (<0.3), consider increasing factors
#   4. Use cross-validation or information criteria (AIC/BIC) to compare models
#   5. Consider economic theory: does the sector have multiple distinct drivers?
#
# **Current settings are examples - adjust based on your data and modeling goals!**
