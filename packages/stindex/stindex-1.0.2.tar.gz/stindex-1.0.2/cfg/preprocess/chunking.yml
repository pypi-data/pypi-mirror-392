# Chunking Configuration
# Settings for document chunking strategies
# Optimized for case study documents (news articles, government reports, health alerts)

# Chunking strategy
# Options: "sliding_window", "paragraph", "element_based", "semantic"
strategy: "sliding_window"

# Sliding window settings
# Balanced for entity extraction and manageable chunk sizes
sliding_window:
  max_chunk_size: 1500        # Optimal for entity extraction
  overlap: 150                 # 10% overlap for continuity
  preserve_sentences: true     # Try to break at sentence boundaries

# Paragraph-based chunking
paragraph:
  max_chunk_size: 1500        # Maximum chunk size
  min_chunk_size: 400         # Minimum chunk size (merge smaller paragraphs)
  overlap: 150                # Overlap between paragraph chunks

# Element-based chunking (preserves document structure)
# Best for structured documents like PDFs with tables and sections
element_based:
  max_chunk_size: 2000        # For structured content
  preserve_titles: true        # Keep titles with their content
  preserve_tables: true        # Keep tables intact
  preserve_lists: true         # Keep lists intact
  metadata_enrichment: true    # Add element type metadata

# Semantic chunking (future)
semantic:
  max_chunk_size: 1500
  embedding_model: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  similarity_threshold: 0.7    # Similarity threshold for grouping

# General settings
general:
  remove_empty_chunks: true    # Remove chunks with no content
  min_word_count: 15           # Minimum words per chunk
  normalize_whitespace: true   # Normalize whitespace in chunks
