# Purposely

> [한국어 문서](docs/ko/README.md) | [Documentation](docs/en/README.md)

**Purpose-Driven Development (PDD) Framework**

Purposely helps you stay aligned with your project's core purpose throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## 🎯 Core Concept

Every project must have a **GLOBAL_PURPOSE** that defines:
- Why does this project exist? (Why)
- What problem does it solve? (Problem)
- How will it solve the problem? (Solution)
- How do we measure success? (Success Metrics)

All Phases, Designs, and Implementations must **continuously align** with this GLOBAL_PURPOSE.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended):

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Initialize Your Project

Run directly without installation using `uvx`:

```bash
# In your project directory
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nicered/purposely purposely init --lang en

# Or in Korean
uvx --from git+https://github.com/nicered/purposely purposely init --lang ko
```

> **Note**: After PyPI publication, you can simply use `uvx purposely init --lang en`

This command creates:
- `.purposely/config.json` - Project configuration
- `docs/` - Documentation directory
- `.claude/` - Claude Code slash commands and templates

### Upgrading Purposely

When a new version of Purposely is released, upgrade your project templates:

```bash
# Check for updates and upgrade
purposely upgrade

# Force reinstall templates even if at latest version
purposely upgrade --force
```

This updates:
- Slash commands (`.claude/commands/`)
- Instructions (`.claude/instructions.md`)
- Config version (`.purposely/config.json`)

**Your documents are preserved** - only templates are updated.

### Creating Documents

Use the `purposely create` command to create documents:

```bash
# Create GLOBAL_PURPOSE
purposely create global-purpose

# Create a new phase
purposely create spec 01

# Create research documents
purposely create research 01 01 "Technology Stack Research"

# Create design documents
purposely create design-overview 01
purposely create design 01 01 "UserService"

# Create plan and implementation
purposely create plan 01
purposely create implementation 01
```

### Using with Claude Code

Purposely is designed for **AI-guided collaborative development**. Use slash commands for interactive document creation:

1. **Create GLOBAL_PURPOSE**: `/purposely-init`
   - AI asks probing questions to understand your true purpose
   - Challenges vague answers, requires measurable metrics
   - Writes the document based on conversation

2. **Start a Phase**: `/purposely-phase`
   - AI reads GLOBAL_PURPOSE first, validates alignment
   - Challenges scope creep ruthlessly
   - Ensures all objectives connect to GLOBAL_PURPOSE

3. **Document Research**: `/purposely-research`
   - AI validates research necessity against SPEC
   - Prevents analysis paralysis
   - Connects findings to design decisions

4. **Write Design**: `/purposely-design`
   - AI reads GLOBAL_PURPOSE + SPEC + RESEARCH
   - Challenges over-engineering
   - Validates design against Success Criteria

5. **Create Plan**: `/purposely-plan`
   - AI reads all previous documents
   - Validates plan achieves all Success Criteria
   - Checks timeline feasibility

6. **Track Implementation**: `/purposely-implement`
   - AI compares actual vs planned
   - Extracts honest learnings
   - Prepares notes for next phase

**The AI is your alignment guardian** - it reads all previous documents and validates every decision against GLOBAL_PURPOSE.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Purpose-Driven Development**: All documents reference GLOBAL_PURPOSE
- **Structured Documentation**: 7 document types with clear hierarchy
- **i18n Support**: English and Korean
- **Claude Code Integration**: Easy document creation with slash commands
- **Consistency Checking**: AI automatically checks alignment with purpose

## 📚 Document Types

### GLOBAL_PURPOSE
The core purpose of your project. **The foundation of everything**.

### SPEC (00_SPEC.md)
Defines objectives, scope, and success criteria for each phase.

### RESEARCH (01_XX_RESEARCH_*.md)
Research and investigation results. Evidence for design decisions.

### DESIGN (02_XX_DESIGN_*.md)
System design. How will it be implemented?

### PLAN (03_PLAN.md)
Concrete implementation plan. Timeline, dependencies, risks.

### IMPLEMENTATION (04_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
Actual implementation log. What was learned? How did it differ from the plan?

## 🔧 Development

### Local Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicered/purposely
cd purposely

# Using uv (recommended)
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or using pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Build

```bash
uv build
# Or: python -m build
```
