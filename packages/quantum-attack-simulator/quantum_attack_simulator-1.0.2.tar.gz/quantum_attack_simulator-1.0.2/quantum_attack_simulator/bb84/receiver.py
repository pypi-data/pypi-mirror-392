def select_random_bases(num_bases):

    Randomly select bases ('Z' or 'X') for quantum state preparation or measurement.

    Parameters:
        num_bases (int): Number of bases to generate.

def measure_quantum_states(qubits, bases):
    """
    Retrieve classical information by analyzing quantum states using specific bases.

    This function performs measurements on quantum states, transforming them into classical bits.
    The choice of measurement basis ('Z' or 'X') determines the process:
    - 'Z' basis extracts information directly in the computational basis.
    - 'X' basis applies a transformation (Hadamard gate) before extracting information.

    Parameters:
        qubits (list): A collection of QuantumCircuit objects representing the quantum states.
        bases (str): A string specifying the bases ('Z' or 'X') for measurements.

    Returns:
        str: A binary string containing the results of the measurements.
