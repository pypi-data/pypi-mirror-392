# Zephyr AI AWS Placeholder

This package intentionally contains only a stub module so that the `zephyr-ai-aws`
distribution name is reserved on PyPI. Future releases will bundle the real AWS Batch
and S3 integrations once the project reaches a stable milestone.

For now, installing this package only sets up the namespace and surfaces a helpful
error message if you attempt to import `zephyr_aws`.
