# ferreus_bbfmm (Python bindings)

Python bindings for the `ferreus_bbfmm` Rust crate.

## Overview

`ferreus_bbfmm` implements the Black Box Fast Multipole Method (BBFMM), a
kernel‑independent hierarchical algorithm for rapidly evaluating all pairwise
interactions in a collection of particles. These Python bindings expose the
same fast, parallel evaluator to Python users.

The library is well‑suited to problems where:

- The interaction kernel is smooth (non‑oscillatory), and
- Many kernel matrix–vector products are required, for example in iterative
  solvers or large‑scale interpolation.

## Install

```bash
pip install ferreus_bbfmm
```

Then in Python:

```python
import ferreus_bbfmm
```

See the [docs](https://graphic-goose.github.io/ferreus_rbf_rs/ferreus_bbfmm/) and `examples/` directories in this package for more detailed
usage and API documentation.
