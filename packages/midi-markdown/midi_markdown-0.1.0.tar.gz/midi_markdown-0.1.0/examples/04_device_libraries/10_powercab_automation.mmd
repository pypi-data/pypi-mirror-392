title: "Line 6 PowerCab Plus - Speaker Automation"
author: "MIDI Markdown Examples"
description: |
  Demonstrates Line 6 PowerCab Plus MIDI control including speaker model switching,
  microphone simulation, mode changes, and real-time parameter automation.

  WHAT IS POWERCAB?
  PowerCab Plus is a smart powered FRFR speaker with onboard DSP for speaker modeling,
  microphone simulation, and impulse response loading. Designed for guitar modelers
  like Helix, but also works with tube amps and analog pedals.

  THREE OPERATING MODES:
  - Flat Mode: Full-range flat response (FRFR) for modelers
  - Speaker Mode: 13 classic guitar speaker models with 16 microphone simulations
  - IR Mode: User-loaded impulse responses (128 slots)

  This example demonstrates:
  - Preset recall via Program Change
  - Real-time speaker/mic changes via Control Change
  - Classic amp-speaker pairings
  - Mode switching and parameter automation
  - Integration techniques with Helix and third-party controllers

# ============================================
# INTEGRATION METHODS
# ============================================

# METHOD 1: HELIX + POWERCAB VIA L6 LINK
# - Connect: Helix L6 LINK OUT → PowerCab L6 LINK IN (110Ω XLR cable)
# - Firmware: Helix 2.80+ and PowerCab 2.0+ required
# - Result: Audio + MIDI over single cable, automatic preset sync
# - Setup: Set PowerCab MIDI channel to match Helix (default 1)
# - Best for: Simplest integration, lowest latency

# METHOD 2: HELIX + POWERCAB VIA MIDI DIN
# - Connect: Helix MIDI OUT → PowerCab MIDI IN (5-pin DIN)
# - Control: Helix Command Center sends CC/PC per snapshot
# - Example: Snapshot 1 → CC22=3 (Jarvis), Snapshot 2 → CC22=1 (Green)
# - Best for: Independent of audio routing, any modeler

# METHOD 3: THIRD-PARTY MIDI CONTROLLER
# - Compatible: Morningstar, RJM Mastermind, Disaster Area, Boss, etc.
# - Connect: Controller MIDI OUT → PowerCab MIDI IN
# - Control: Footswitches send PC (presets) or CC (parameters)
# - Best for: Dedicated PowerCab control

# METHOD 4: STEREO POWERCAB PAIR (DAISY-CHAIN)
# - Connect: Controller → PowerCab #1 IN → PowerCab #2 IN
# - Setup: Same MIDI channel, MIDI Thru enabled on #1
# - Result: Both units respond to same messages
# - L6 Link: Auto splits stereo (left → #1, right → #2)
# - Best for: Stereo rigs, dual-amp setups

# METHOD 5: TUBE AMP + POWERCAB
# - Connect: Tube amp speaker out → PowerCab INPUT 1 (Line level)
# - Mode: Speaker mode for cab simulation on XLR to FOH
# - Control: MIDI controller switches models per song
# - Result: Speaker as monitor, XLR to PA/recording
# - Best for: Hybrid tube amp + digital control

# ============================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE
# ============================================

# ISSUE: First preset change goes to wrong preset
# SOLUTION: Use powercab_preset_safe alias (includes initialization delay)

# ISSUE: HF driver inconsistent behavior
# SOLUTION: Send explicit CC5 values per preset, avoid expression pedals

# ISSUE: Pops/clicks when changing parameters
# SOLUTION: Use 50-100ms spacing ([+50ms] timing) between messages

# ISSUE: MIDI not responding
# SOLUTION: Check channel match, verify PC Receive enabled in Global Settings

# ISSUE: L6 Link not working
# SOLUTION: Update firmware (Helix 2.80+, PowerCab 2.0+), use 110Ω cable

# ISSUE: Volume drop via L6 Link
# SOLUTION: Adjust Helix output +10dB or PowerCab input CC1 +10dB

# ISSUE: Speaker models 6-12 missing
# SOLUTION: Update PowerCab Plus firmware to 2.0+ via Line 6 Updater

# ============================================
# MODEL COMPATIBILITY
# ============================================

# PowerCab 112 Plus: Single 12" speaker, mono, full MIDI (all features in this file)
# PowerCab 212 Plus: Dual 12" speakers, stereo, full MIDI + CC102-104 for Speaker 1
# PowerCab 112/212 (non-Plus): NO MIDI capability whatsoever (Plus required)
# PowerCab CL (112/212): Limited MIDI (only CC7, CC68-71, no Program Change)
