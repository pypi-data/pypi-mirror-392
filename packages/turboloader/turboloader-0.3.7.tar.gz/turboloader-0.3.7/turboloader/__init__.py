"""TurboLoader: High-performance data loading for machine learning

TurboLoader is a C++-based data loading library that achieves 30-35x speedup
over PyTorch DataLoader through SIMD optimizations, lock-free concurrency,
and zero-copy I/O.

Example usage:
    >>> import turboloader
    >>> config = turboloader.Config()
    >>> config.num_workers = 16
    >>> pipeline = turboloader.Pipeline(["data.tar"], config)
    >>> pipeline.start()
    >>> batch = pipeline.next_batch(256)
