[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.15101012.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15101012)

This Sphinx extension fixes:
- with a `layout` patch:
    - an issue where drop down menus would still take up space after being minimized, and the patch fixes it through some css.
    - an issue where in drop down code cells the shown summary remained lightgray instead of turning darkgrey. Fix through css.
    - an issue where the size of code in a header is not the correct font size. Fix through css.
    - an issue where the sidebar shows a scrollbar even if that's not needed
    - an issue where the margin causes a scroll bar for a window between 992 and 1200px.
    - an issue where the caption text of a figure is aligned on the left for multi-line caption text
- with a `button` patch:
    - an issue where two buttons for interactive matplotlib widget do not appear.
- with a `mathjax` patch:
    - an issue where in the Firefox browser the CHTML renderer of MathJax does not render thin lines consistently. Fixed by selecting the SVG renderer *only* for the Firefox browser. 
- with a `download` patch:
    - an issue where the standard download button for downloading `.ipynb` and `.md` files opens a new tab in some browsers instead of downloading the file. Fixed by adding the `download` attribute to the download links.
- with a `hash` patch:
    - an issue where if the URL contains a specific element id, the page scrolls to the element on the initial/partial page load and does not scroll to that element after complete page load. Fixed by adding a small javascript that scrolls to the element after complete page load.

## Installation
To install the Sphinx-JupyterBook-Patches, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Install the Package**

Install the `jupyterbook_patches` package using `pip`:
```
pip install jupyterbook_patches
```

**Step 2: Add to `requirements.txt`**

Make sure that the package is included in your project's `requirements.txt` to track the dependency:
```
jupyterbook_patches
```

**Step 3: Enable in `_config.yml`**

In your `_config.yml` file, add the extension to the list of Sphinx extra extensions:
```
sphinx: 
    extra_extensions:
        - jupyterbook_patches
```

**Step 4 (optional): Disable patches in `_config.yml`**

In your `_config.yml` file, add disable patches you do not wish:
```
sphinx: 
    config:
        patch_config:
            disabled-patches: []
```

Replace `[]` by a list of strings to disable patches. Use the patch name as indicated at the top of this document.

For example, to disable the `mathjax` patch:

```
sphinx: 
    config:
        patch_config:
            disabled-patches: ["mathjax"]
```

For example, to disable the `layout` and `button` patches:

```
sphinx: 
    config:
        patch_config:
            disabled-patches: ["button","layout"]
```
