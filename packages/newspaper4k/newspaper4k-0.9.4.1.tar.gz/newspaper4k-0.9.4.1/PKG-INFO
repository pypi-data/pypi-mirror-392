# Newspaper4k: Article Scraping & Curation, a continuation of the beloved newspaper3k by codelucas
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/newspaper4k.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/newspaper4k)
![Build status](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)
[![Coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/newspaper4k/badge/?version=latest)](https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Newspaper4k Project grew from a fork of the well known newspaper3k  by [codelucas](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) which was not updated since September 2020. The initial goal of this fork was to keep the project alive and to add new features and fix bugs. As of version 0.9.3 there are many new features and improvements that make Newspaper4k a great tool for article scraping and curation. To make the migration to Newspaper4k easier, all the classes and methods from the original project were kept and the new features were added on top of them. All API calls from  the original project still work as expected, such that for users familiar with newspaper3k you will feel right at home with Newspaper4k.

At the moment of the fork, in the original project were over 400 open issues, which I have duplicated, and as of v 0.9.3 only about 180 issues still need to be verified (many are already fixed, but it's pretty cumbersome to check - [hint hint ... anyone contributing?](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/newspaper4k/discussions/606)). If you have any issues or feature requests please open an issue here.

## Python compatibility
    - Python 3.10+ minimum

# Quick start

``` bash
pip install newspaper4k
```

## Using the CLI

You can start directly from the command line, using the included CLI:
``` bash
python -m newspaper --url="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/17/success/job-seekers-use-ai/index.html" --language=en --output-format=json --output-file=article.json

```
More information about the CLI can be found in the [CLI documentation](https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/cli_reference.html).

![cli demo](docs/_static/recording-cli.gif)



## Using the Python API

Alternatively, you can use Newspaper4k in Python:

### Processing one article / url at a time

``` python
import newspaper

article = newspaper.article('https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/29/sport/nfl-week-8-how-to-watch-spt-intl/index.html')

print(article.authors)
# ['Hannah Brewitt']

print(article.publish_date)

## Parsing and scraping whole News Sources (websites) using the Source Class

This way you can build a Source object from a newspaper websites. This class will allow you to get all the articles and categories on the website. When you build the source, articles are not yet downloaded. The `build()` call will  parse front page, will detect category links (if possible), get any RSS feeds published by the news site, and will create a list of article links.
You need to call `download_articles()` to download the articles, but note that it can take a significant time.

`download_articles()` will download the articles in a multithreaded fashion using `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent` package. The number of concurrent threads can be configured in `Configuration`.`number_threads` or passed as an argument to `build()`.


``` python
import newspaper

cnn_paper = newspaper.build('http://cnn.com', number_threads=3)
print(cnn_paper.category_urls())

# ['https://cnn.com', 'https://money.cnn.com', 'https://arabic.cnn.com',
# 'https://cnnespanol.cnn.com', 'http://edition.cnn.com',
# 'https://edition.cnn.com', 'https://us.cnn.com', 'https://www.cnn.com']

article_urls = [article.url for article in cnn_paper.articles]
print(article_urls[:3])
# ['https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2023/10/30/number-of-hostages-held-in-gaza-now-up-to-239-idf-spokesperson',
# 'https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/video/2023/10/30/v146619-sotu-sullivan-hostage-negotiations',
# 'https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2023/10/29/norwegian-pm-israel-gaza']


article = cnn_paper.articles[0]
article.download()
article.parse()

print(article.title)
# المتحدث باسم الجيش الإسرائيلي: عدد الرهائن المحتجزين في غزة يصل إلى

```
Or if you want to get bulk articles from the website (have in mind that this could take a long time and could get your IP blocked by the newssite):

``` python
import newspaper

cnn_source = newspaper.build('http://cnn.com', number_threads=3)

print(len(newspaper.article_urls))

articles = source.download_articles()

print(len(articles))

print(articles[0].title)
```



## As of version 0.9.3, Newspaper4k supports Google News as a special Source object

First, make sure you have the `google` extra installed, since we rely on the [Gnews package](https://github.com/ranahaani/GNews/) to get the articles from Google News. You can install it using pip like this:

``` bash
pip install newspaper4k[gnews]
```

Then you can use the `GoogleNews` class to get articles from Google News:
``` python
from newspaper.google_news import GoogleNewsSource

source = GoogleNewsSource(
    country="US",
    period="7d",
    max_results=10,
)

source.build(top_news=True)

print(source.article_urls())
# ['https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/politics/trump-464-million-dollar-bond/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/18/politics/supreme-court-new-york-nra/index.html', ...
source.download_articles()
```


## Multilanguage features

Newspaper can extract and detect languages *seamlessly* based on the article meta tags. Additionally, you can specify the language for the website / article.  If no language is specified, Newspaper will attempt to auto detect a language from the available meta data. The fallback language is English.

Language detection is crucial for accurate article extraction. If the wrong language is detected or provided, chances are that no article text will be returned. Before parsing, check that your language is supported by our package.

``` python
from newspaper import Article

article = Article('https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-67084358')
article.download()
article.parse()

print(article.title)
# 晶片大战：台湾厂商助攻华为突破美国封锁？

if article.config.use_meta_language:
  # If we use the autodetected language, this config attribute will be true
  print(article.meta_lang)
else:
  print(article.config.language)

# zh
```

# Evaluation

## Evaluation Results


Using the dataset from [ScrapingHub](https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark) I created an [evaluator script](tests/evaluation/evaluate.py) that compares the performance of newspaper against it's previous versions. This way we can see how newspaper updates improve or worsen the performance of the library.

Precision, Recall and F1 are computed using overlap of shingles with n-grams of size 4. The corpus BLEU score is computed using the [nltk's bleu_score](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.bleu).

We also use our own, newly created dataset, the [Newspaper Article Extraction Benchmark](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/article-extraction-dataset) (NAEB) which is a collection of over 400 articles from 200 different news sources to evaluate the performance of the library.

## 0.9.3.1 (2024-03-18)

Some fixes with regards to python >= 3.11 dependencies. Numpy version was incompatible with colab. Now it is fixed.
Also, there was a typo in the Nepali language code - it was "np" instead of "ne". This is now fixed.

## 0.9.3 (2024-03-18)
Massive improvements in multi-language capabilities. Added over 40 new languages and completely reworked the language module. Much easier to add new languages now. Additionally, added support for Google News as a source. You can now search and parse news based on keywords, topic, location or website.
Integrated cloudscraper as an optional dependency. If installed, it will us cloudscraper as a layer over requests. Cloudscraper tries to bypass cloudflair protection.
We now have use two evaluation datasets - the one from scrapinghub and one created by us drom the top 200 most popular websites. This will help keeping track of future improvements and to have a clear view of the impact of the changes.

We see a steady improvement from version 0.9.0 up to 0.9.3. The evaluation results are available in the documentation. The evaluation dataset is also available in the following repository: [Article Extraction Dataset](https://github.com/AndyTheFactory/article-extraction-dataset)

## 0.9.2 (2024-01-14)
Some major changes in document parsing. In previous versions the chance that parts of the article body were missing was high. In addition, in some cases the order of the paragraphs was not correct. This release should fix these issues.

Highlighted features:
- You can now us the module as a command line interface (CLI). Usage: `python -m newspaper --url https://www.test.com`. More information in the [documentation](https://newspaper4k.readthedocs.io/).
- I have added an evaluation script against a dataset from [scrapinghub](https://github.com/scrapinghub/article-extraction-benchmark/). This will help keeping track of future improvements.
- Better handling of multithreaded requests. The previous version had a bug that could lead to a deadlock. I implemented ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module, which is more stable. The previously `news_pool` was replaced with a `fetch_news()` function.
- Caching is now much more flexible. You can disable it completely or for one request.
- You can now use `newspaper.article()` function for convenience. It will create, download and parse an article in one step. It takes all the parameters of the `Article` class.
- protected sites by cloudflare are better detected and raise an exception. The reason will be in the exception message.
