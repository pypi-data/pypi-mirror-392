1.0.0 (2025-06-12)
------------------

  a pywsgi version which doesn't only require str.

------------------

- python 2.7 migration

- feature: Suport username and password in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for setup
  Authentication Basic header.

- feature: Support Bearer token in getJSONRPCTestProxy used for Authentication
  Bearer header.


0.9.0 (2017-09-18)
------------------

- feature: implemented ZODB support. Now it's possible to use p01.publisher
  and use a ZODB not only a WSGI application.

- renamed p01.publisher.traversers to p01.publisher.traverser

- enable threadSiteSubscriber and clearThreadSiteSubscriber event subscriber
  handler


0.8.0 (2017-01-24)
------------------

- bugfix: transaction >= 2.0.3 uses unicode for transaction note. See comment
  in transaction CHANGES.txt. The user and description fields must now be set
  with text (unicode) data. Previously, if bytes were provided, they’d be
  decoded as ASCII. It was decided that this would lead to bugs that were hard
  to test for.


0.7.0 (2016-09-19)
------------------

- feature: re-implemented json reader and writer concept. Use reader and writer
  from p01.json.api

- bugfix: support PATH_INFO in JSONRPCTestTransport used by the test method
  getJSONRPCTestProxy. This ensures that we traverse to the related context
  for calling the json-rpc method.

- feature: use JSONRPCProxy from p01.json as json-rpc test proxy

- sort response header before return, except Status and X-Powered-By


0.6.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- feature: added application/json support. The new request json method returns
  the json formated data given from a request with content type applicaton/json.
  The raw content is stored in the request raw property if such json content
  is given.

- added OPTIONS to allwed request methods. This allows to handle cross origin
  request given from android phones during development. Note, you ned to
  register a view for handle such requests. We just added the OPTIONS as a
  general allowed request method.

- feature: use new testbrowser concept based on zope.testbrowser >= 5.0.0.
  This new testbrowser concept uses a wsgi application and is based on webtest.
  Currently we use p01.testbrowser which is a clone of zope.testbrowser because
  there is no zope.testbrowser release yet.

- feature: implemented simple JSONRPCTestProxy based on wsgi app. This new
  test json rpc proxy uses the wsgi application publisher for process a
  request.

- backport zope.publisher publication factory lookup. Improve the publication
  factory lookup by falling back to a more generic registration if the specific
  factory chooses not to handle the request after all


0.5.0 (2014-03-24)
------------------

- initial release
