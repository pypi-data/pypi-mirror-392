# PostGresql Task Queue (PGTQ)

A very simple task queue system built on PostgreSQL. PGTQ was designed to solve
the following use case:

1. I have one or more 'controllers' which will enqueue many tasks to be run in a
   PostgreSQL database.
2. I have one or more 'workers' which will dequeue tasks from the database and
   execute them.

## Installation

You can install PGTQ via pip:

```bash
pip install pgtq
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use PGTQ:

```python
# controller.py
from pgtq import PGTQ

# Initialize the task queue
pgtq = PGTQ(dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")

pgtq.install() # Create necessary tables (only needed once, but it's safe to call multiple times)

# Enqueue a task
pgtq.enqueue("add_numbers", args={"a": i, "b": i * 2})
```

```python
# worker.py
from pgtq import PGTQ

# Initialize the task queue
pgtq = PGTQ(dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")

@pgtq.task("add_numbers")
def add_numbers(a, b):
    print("Adding:", a, "+", b, "=", a + b)
    return a + b

pgtq.start_worker()
```

For more detailed examples, see the `examples/` directory in the repository.
