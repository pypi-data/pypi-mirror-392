"""Mixin utilities for class composition and behavior extension.

This module provides metaclasses and mixins that facilitate class composition
through the mixin pattern. It includes utilities for:
- Automatic method logging with performance tracking
- Abstract class implementation enforcement with type checking
- Combined metaclasses that merge multiple behaviors

These utilities help create robust class hierarchies with proper implementation
enforcement and built-in logging capabilities.
