# VoiceMD - Voice Analysis Application

A modern, offline voice analysis tool that predicts speaker characteristics based on acoustic features.

## Features

- 🎨 **Modern Interface** - Clean, intuitive GUI with modern design
- 🔄 **Multi-Model Support** - Switch between different trained models in real-time
- 💾 **Fully Offline** - No internet required after initial setup
- 🎤 **Multiple Formats** - Supports WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A
- 📦 **Easy Installation** - Simple pip install, models auto-download

## Installation

### Requirements

- **Python 3.8 - 3.13** (Python 3.14+ not yet supported - dependencies `numba`/`llvmlite` don't support 3.14. Use Python 3.13 or earlier)
- ~500 MB disk space (including models and dependencies)
- Internet connection for first-time model download only

### Quick Install (Recommended - No Git Required!)

```bash
pip install voicemd-gui
```

Then run:

```bash
voicemd-gui
```

Models (~4.4 MB) will automatically download from GitHub Releases on first launch.

### Alternative Install (From GitHub)

If you want the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd.git
```

### Manual Install (From Source)

1. Download the repository as ZIP from GitHub
2. Extract it
3. Open terminal in the extracted folder
4. Run: `pip install .`
5. Run: `voicemd-gui`

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to run from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd.git
cd voicemd

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_app.txt

# Run the app
python app_gui.py
```

Models will auto-download on first run, or manually run:
```bash
python download_models.py
```

## Usage

1. Select a model from the dropdown (Small Dataset or CommonVoice)
2. Browse for an audio file (WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, M4A)
3. Click "Analyze Voice"
4. View results instantly

## Uninstallation

### Remove the Application

```bash
pip uninstall voicemd-gui -y
```

### Remove Downloaded Models (Optional)

The model files (~4.4 MB) are stored separately and will remain after uninstalling. To completely remove them:

**Windows:**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.voicemd"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.voicemd
```

**Location of models:**
- When installed via pip: `~/.voicemd/models/` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.voicemd\models\` on Windows)
- When running from source: Project root directory

## Multi-Model Support

VoiceMD includes two trained models that can be switched at runtime:

- **Small Dataset Model** - Faster, good for general use
- **CommonVoice Model** - More robust, handles diverse accents

Switch between models using the dropdown in the app. No restart required!

## Troubleshooting

### Models Won't Download

**Download manually:**
1. Go to https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd/releases
2. Download both `.pt` model files
3. Place them in the project root directory

**Or use the download script:**
```bash
python download_models.py
```

### Import Errors

Update dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements_app.txt
```

### Audio Loading Issues

The app uses soundfile/librosa (no FFmpeg required). If you still get errors:
- **Windows:** `choco install ffmpeg`
- **macOS:** `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

### LLVM Version Compatibility (Linux)

If you get an error like `llvmlite only officially supports LLVM 20` during installation:

**Option 1 - Use Conda (Recommended):**
```bash
conda create -n voicemd python=3.10
conda activate voicemd
conda install -c conda-forge llvmlite numba
pip install git+https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd.git
```

**Option 2 - Install specific LLVM version:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install llvm-14 llvm-14-dev
export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-14
pip install git+https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd.git
```

**Option 3 - Use older Python:**
```bash
# Python 3.9 or 3.10 have better llvmlite compatibility
python3.10 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Honey181/voicemd.git
```

## Technical Details

- **Framework:** PyTorch for model inference
- **GUI:** Tkinter for cross-platform interface
- **Audio Processing:** librosa, soundfile, torchaudio
- **No FFmpeg Required:** Uses soundfile/librosa for audio loading
