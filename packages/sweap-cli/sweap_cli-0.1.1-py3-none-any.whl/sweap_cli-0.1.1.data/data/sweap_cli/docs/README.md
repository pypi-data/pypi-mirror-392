# SWEAP CLI Docs

This directory contains end-user documentation for the SWEAP command-line
tooling. Pick the guide that matches your role:

- **Task authors** – follow [task-authoring.md](task-authoring.md) for a
  step-by-step workflow from scaffolding to remote validation.
- **Quality reviewers** – review expectations and validation flow in
  [reviewing.md](reviewing.md).
- **Command reference** – consult [reference/cli.md](reference/cli.md) for
  available commands and [reference/manifest.md](reference/manifest.md) for the
  manifest schema.
- **Troubleshooting** – keep [faq.md](faq.md) handy for common issues.

When updating documentation, place new material alongside these guides so
contributors and users can find it easily.
