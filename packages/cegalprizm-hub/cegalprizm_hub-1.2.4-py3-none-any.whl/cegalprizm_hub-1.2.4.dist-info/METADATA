# Introduction

A Python client library to use with a Cegal Hub Server and Cegal Hub Connector applications. Cegal Hub allows for exchange of data and messages across process boundaries on the local machine or across a network or internet. Out of the box the library allows for working with local or remote Cegal Hub Agents or Cegal Hub Connectors such as the Cegal Hub Petrel Connector and for queries against a running Cegal Hub Server which may also be local or remote. The library is designed to be consumed by other Python libraries with knowledge about specific Cegal Hub Connectors and functionality. Cegal Hub is secured using Cegal Keystone.

# Usage

1. Configure logging (Optional) 
2. Create a Hub object to work with a Cegal Hub Server
3. Make queries against a running Cegal Hub Server
4. Make client requests against Cegal Hub Connector applications


# Basic Example working with a local running Cegal Hub Server

```python
import logging

# Import the Hub object
from cegalprizm.hub import Hub

# Configure logging to stdout with info level
logging.getLogger()
logging.basicConfig(
    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s",
    level=logging.INFO,
    stream=sys.stdout,
)

# Create a Hub object
hub = Hub()

# Verify that the local Hub Server is running
hub.verify_health()

# Check that the version of the Python client library is compatible with the running Hub Server
hub.is_version_compatible()

# Query the server
hub.print_query_server()

# Query the available connectors
hub.print_query_connectors()
```
