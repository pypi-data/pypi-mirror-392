"""Pydantic models for parsing incoming Frame.io webhook and action events.

This module provides the data structures that your application's event handlers
will receive. When Frame.io sends a POST request to your endpoint, the `App`
will automatically parse the JSON payload into one of these Pydantic models.
This ensures that the data your handler receives is validated and fully typed,
allowing for robust and predictable code with excellent editor support.

The models are structured with a `_BaseEvent` to hold common fields, and two
specific subclasses (`WebhookEvent`, `ActionEvent`) to handle structural
differences in the payloads, while convenience properties like `account_id` and
`resource_id` provide a consistent access pattern in your code.
