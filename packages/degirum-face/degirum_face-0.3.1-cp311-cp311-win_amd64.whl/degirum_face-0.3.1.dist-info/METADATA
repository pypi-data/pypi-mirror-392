## Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|Tutorials.ipynb| Jupyter notebook with face recognition & tracking tutorials. |
|face_recognition_enroll.py| Example how to add face embeddings to the ReID database from images.|
|face_recognition_simple.py| Example how to recognize people from a set of images. Requires face database to be filled by `face_recognition_enroll.py`.|
|face_tracking_web_app.py| Full-featured web application for real time intruder detection with NVR capabilities and notifications. Has GUI for adding known faces to face database based on captured video clips of unknown faces. |
|face_tracking_simple.py| Subset of `face_tracking_web_app.py`, which does real time intruder detection part displaying live preview in local window. Requires known face database to be filled by `face_tracking_web_app.py` or `face_tracking_add_embeddings.py` |
|face_tracking_add_embeddings.py| Subset of `face_tracking_web_app.py`, which adds known faces to face database based on captured video clips of unknown faces. Requires such video clips to be captured by either `face_tracking_web_app.py` or `face_tracking_simple.py` |
|find_similar_faces.py| Example how to find all photos with similar faces to a given input image. |
|group_similar_faces.py| Example how to find groups of photos featuring similar faces. |
