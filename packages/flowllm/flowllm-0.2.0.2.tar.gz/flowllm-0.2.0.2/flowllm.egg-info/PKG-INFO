              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### ⭐ 核心特性

- **简单易用的 Op 开发**：继承 BaseOp 或 BaseAsyncOp 基类，实现业务逻辑即可。FlowLLM提供了延迟初始化的 LLM、Embedding 模型和向量库，开发者只需通过 `self.llm`、`self.embedding_model`、`self.vector_store` 即可轻松使用这些资源。同时FlowLLM提供了完整的 Prompt 模板管理能力，通过 `prompt_format()` 和 `get_prompt()` 方法进行格式化和使用。

- **灵活的 Flow 编排**：通过 YAML 配置文件将 Op 组合成 Flow，支持灵活的编排方式。`>>` 表示串行组合，`|` 表示并行组合，例如 `SearchOp() >> (AnalyzeOp() | TranslateOp()) >> FormatOp()` 可构建复杂的工作流。定义输入输出 Schema 后，使用 `flowllm config=your_config` 命令即可启动服务。

- **自动生成服务**：配置完成后，FlowLLM 会自动生成 HTTP、MCP 和 CMD 服务。HTTP 服务提供标准的 RESTful API，支持同步 JSON 响应和 HTTP Stream 流式响应。MCP 服务会自动注册为 Model Context Protocol 工具，可集成到支持 MCP 的客户端中。CMD 服务支持命令行模式执行单个 Op，适合快速测试和调试。

## ⚡ 快速开始

### 📦 Step0 安装

#### 📥 From PyPI

```bash
pip install flowllm
```

#### 🔧 From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowllm-ai/flowllm.git
cd flowllm
pip install -e .
```

详细安装与配置方法请参考 [安装指南](docs/zh/guide/installation.md)。

### ⚙️ 配置

创建 `.env` 文件，配置 API Key。你可以从 `example.env` 复制并修改：

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

然后在 `.env` 文件中配置你的 API Key：

```bash
FLOW_LLM_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
FLOW_LLM_BASE_URL=https://xxxx/v1
FLOW_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
FLOW_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=https://xxxx/v1
```

详细配置说明请参考 [配置指南](docs/zh/guide/config_guide.md)。

### 🛠️ Step1 构建Op

```python
from flowllm.core.context import C
from flowllm.core.op import BaseAsyncOp
from flowllm.core.schema import Message
from flowllm.core.enumeration import Role

@C.register_op()
class SimpleChatOp(BaseAsyncOp):
    async def async_execute(self):
        query = self.context.get("query", "")
        messages = [Message(role=Role.USER, content=query)]
        response = await self.llm.achat(messages=messages)
        self.context.response.answer = response.content.strip()
```

详细内容请参考 [简单 Op 指南](docs/zh/guide/async_op_minimal_guide.md)、[LLM Op 指南](docs/zh/guide/async_op_llm_guide.md) 和 [高级 Op 指南](docs/zh/guide/async_op_advance_guide.md)（包含 Embedding、VectorStore 和并发执行等高级功能）。

### 📝 Step2 配置config

以下示例展示如何构建一个 MCP（Model Context Protocol）服务。创建配置文件 `my_mcp_config.yaml`：

```yaml
backend: mcp

mcp:
  transport: sse
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8001

flow:
  demo_mcp_flow:
    flow_content: MockSearchOp()
    description: "Search results for a given query."
    input_schema:
      query:
        type: string
        description: "User query"
        required: true

llm:
  default:
    backend: openai_compatible
    model_name: qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507
    params:
      temperature: 0.6
```

### 🚀 Step3 启动 MCP 服务

```bash
flowllm \
  config=my_mcp_config \
  backend=mcp \  # 可选，覆盖config配置
  mcp.transport=sse \  # 可选，覆盖config配置
  mcp.port=8001 \  # 可选，覆盖config配置
  llm.default.model_name=qwen3-30b-a3b-thinking-2507  # 可选，覆盖config配置
```
