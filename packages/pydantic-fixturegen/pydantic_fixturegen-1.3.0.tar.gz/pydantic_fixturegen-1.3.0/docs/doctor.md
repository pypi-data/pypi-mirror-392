# Doctor & diagnostics: keep projects healthy

> Audit discovery coverage, diff generated artifacts, and validate configuration before you ship.

## `pfg doctor`

```bash
pfg doctor ./models.py --fail-on-gaps 0 --json-errors
```

- Scans models for uncovered fields, risky imports, and sandbox warnings.
- Discovery options match `pfg list`: `--ast`, `--hybrid`, `--include`, `--exclude`, `--timeout`, `--memory-limit-mb`.
- Use `--fail-on-gaps <N>` to exit with code `2` when more than `N` fields lack providers (set `0` to fail on any gap).
- `--json-errors` prints structured diagnostic payloads, enabling CI gating.
- Extra-type awareness: doctor now calls out `pydantic-extra-types` annotations that don't have providers loaded (for example when the optional dependency is missing) so you can install the extra or override the field before it reaches production.

Review the report to see gap summaries grouped by type, recommended remediations, and severity levels.

## `pfg diff`

```bash
pfg diff ./models.py \
  --json-out artifacts/current.json \
  --fixtures-out tests/fixtures/test_models.py \
  --schema-out schema \
  --show-diff \
  --seed 42 \
  --freeze-seeds
```

- Regenerates artifacts in an isolated sandbox and compares them with existing files.
- Writes JSON summaries per artifact when you provide output paths; `--show-diff` streams unified diffs.
- Combine with frozen seeds to ensure deterministic comparisons.
- Exit code is non-zero when diffs are detected, making it ideal for pre-commit hooks.

## `pfg check`

```bash
pfg check ./models.py --json-errors --fixtures-out /tmp/fixtures.py
```

- Validates configuration, discovery, and emitter destinations without writing new artifacts.
- Mirrors `diff` output options (`--json-out`, `--fixtures-out`, `--schema-out`).
- Helpful for CI smoke tests before running heavier generation steps.

## Workflow tips

- Run `pfg doctor` locally when adding new models to reveal missing providers early.
- Use `pfg diff` in CI to enforce deterministic fixtures before merging pull requests.
- Insert `pfg check` into lightweight pipelines or commits to block invalid configuration without touching the filesystem.
- Pair diagnostics with structured [logging](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/pydantic-fixturegen/blob/main/docs/logging.md) for machine-readable auditing.
- When you see sandbox violations, review [security](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/pydantic-fixturegen/blob/main/docs/security.md) to adjust discovery mode or output paths.
