This module extends package types Odoo feature in order to better manage
stock moves with packages according to the packaging and stock location
properties (like height, weight or any customized conditions).

Moreover, this module implements "package type put-away strategy" in
order to compute a put-away location using package types.

The standard put-away strategy is applied *before* the package type
put-away strategy as the former relies on product or product category
and the latter relies on stock packages.

In other words, when a move is reserved, Odoo standard put-away strategy
will be applied to compute a new destination on the stock move lines,
according to the product. After this first "put-away computation", the
"package type" put-away strategy is applied, if the reserved quant is
linked to a package defining a package type.

Storage locations linked to the package type are processed sequentially,
if said storage location is a child of the move line's destination
location (i.e either the put-away location or the move's destination
location). For each location, their package type strategy is applied as
well as the restrictions defined on the storage category. If no suitable
location is found, the next location in the sequence will be searched
and so on.

For the package type putaway strategy "None", the location is considered
as is. For the "ordered children" strategy, children locations are
sorted by first by max height which is a physical constraint to respect,
then pack putaway sequence which allow to favor for example some level
or corridor, and finally by name.

At the end, if found location is not the same as the original
destination location, the putaway strategies are applied (e.g.: A "None"
pack putaway strategy is set on computed location and a putaway rule
exists on that one).
