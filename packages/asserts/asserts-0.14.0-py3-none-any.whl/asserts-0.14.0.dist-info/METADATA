Stand-alone Assertions for Python

This package provides a few advantages over the assertions provided by
unittest.TestCase:

- Can be used stand-alone, for example:
  - In test cases, not derived from TestCase.
  - In fake and mock classes.
  - In implementations as rich alternative to the assert statement.
- PEP 8 compliance.
- Custom stand-alone assertions can be written easily.
- Arguably a better separation of concerns, since TestCase is responsible
  for test running only, if assertion functions are used exclusively.

There are a few regressions compared to assertions from TestCase:

- The default assertion class (`AssertionError`) can not be overwritten. This
  is rarely a problem in practice.
- asserts does not support the `addTypeEqualityFunc()` functionality.

Usage:

```python
>>> from asserts import assert_true, assert_equal, assert_raises
>>> my_var = 13
>>> assert_equal(13, my_var)
>>> assert_true(True, msg="custom failure message")
>>> with assert_raises(KeyError):
...     raise KeyError()
```

Failure messages can be customized:

```python
>>> assert_equal(13, 14, msg_fmt="{got} is wrong, expected {expected}")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
AssertionError: 14 is wrong, expected 13
```
