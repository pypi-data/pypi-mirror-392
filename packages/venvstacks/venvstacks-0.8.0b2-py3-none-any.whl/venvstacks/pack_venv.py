"""Utility library to convert Python virtual environments to portable archives."""

# This is conceptually inspired by conda-pack (but structured somewhat differently).
# venv-pack and venv-pack2 were considered, and may still be an option in the future,
# but for now, something narrowly focused on the needs of the venvstacks project
# is the preferred option.
#
# This is primarily about reducing the number of potential sources of bugs - while
# conda-pack appears to be reasonably well used, venv-pack/venv-pack2 are much less
# popular, as there's a competing approach for regular virtual environments in
# https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/wagon (where an archive of pre-built wheels is
# shipped to target systems, and then `venv` and `pip` in `--no-index` mode are run
# directly on the target to create the deployed virtual environments).

# Requirements:
#
# * must work on Linux, Windows, macOS
# * internal symlinks are permitted but not required (e.g. on Windows)
# * relative external symlinks to adjacent folders are similarly permitted
# * external symlinks beyond that boundary are converted to hard links
# * zip archives are used on Windows, tar.xz archives on other platforms

# Allowances/limitations:
#
# * archives for a given target platform are built on the same platform
# * all entry point scripts are removed, as Python is explicitly invoked on target systems
# * environment activation scripts are dropped from the archives rather than fixed on target
# * RECORD files are edited to remove references to files with build dependent hashes
#   (specifically, scripts that have their shebang lines rewritten at install time)
# * all __pycache__ folders are omitted (as their contents incorporate absolute paths)
#
# Note: stacks.py covers dropping the activation scripts and files with shebang lines,
#       as well as editing the installed distribution package RECORD files accordingly

# Basic progress bar support, taken from ncoghlan's SO answer at
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3160699/python-progress-bar/78590319#78590319
# (since the code originated with her, and she also implemented it here,
# it isn't subject to Stack Overflow's CC-BY-SA terms)
#
# Archiving pytorch (and similarly large AI/ML libraries) takes a long time,
# so you really need some assurance that progress is being made.
#
# TODO: Replace this with https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html
#       now that rich has been adopted as a direct project CLI dependency
#
# If compression times are a significant problem, it would be worth moving in the same
# direction as conda-pack did, and implementing support for parallel compression (the
# compression libraries all drop the GIL when compressing data chunks, so this approach
# scales effectively up to the number of available CPUs)
