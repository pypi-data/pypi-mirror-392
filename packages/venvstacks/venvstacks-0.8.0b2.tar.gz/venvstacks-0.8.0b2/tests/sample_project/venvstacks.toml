# Sample Python runtime, framework and application layers for venvstacks testing
# 
# While it is recommended that all layers use the same runtime, allowance is made for
# multiple runtimes to handle incremental migrations to newer Python versions (e.g. shipping
# both Python 3.11 and 3.12 as different frameworks and applications are migrated rather than
# having to migrate everything all at once)

# By default, inplace runtime and framework updates are permitted without requiring layers
# that depend on them to be updated (this allows lower impact security and maintenance
# updates to the runtime and framework layers).
#
# If an update does imply compatibility issues for higher layers, then either it needs to
# be handled as a new layer with an updated name (e.g. appending a version number), or
# else affected higher layer components need to be updated at the same time.

# Each layer definition may include a `platforms` list that specifies which platforms the
# layer should be built for. This is intended for use when particular frameworks only
# support a subset of an overall applications target platforms (for example, LM Studio
# supports MLX, but only on macOS with Apple silicon).
