Testing ON GOTO and ON GOSUB
=============================

Test 1: ON 1 GOTO (jump to first line)
Jumped to line 1000 (X=1)

Test 2: ON 2 GOTO (jump to second line)
Jumped to line 2100 (Y=2)

Test 3: ON 3 GOTO (jump to third line)
Jumped to line 3200 (Z=3)

Test 4: ON 0 GOTO (no jump, continue)
Continued to next line (W=0)

Test 5: ON 1 GOSUB (call first subroutine)
In subroutine 5000 (A=1)
Returned from subroutine

Test 6: ON 2 GOSUB (call second subroutine)
In subroutine 6100 (B=2)
Returned from subroutine

Test 7: ON with expression (2+1=3)
In subroutine 7200 (C+1=3)
Returned from subroutine

ON GOTO/GOSUB tests complete!
