Testing Error Handling
======================

Test 1: ON ERROR with RESUME NEXT
Before error
Error caught! ERR =11
After error (via RESUME NEXT)

Test 2: RESUME to retry (with fix)
Error! Setting Y=2 and retrying
Division succeeded: 10 / 2 = 5 

Test 3: RESUME to specific line
Resuming to line 360
Target line reached

Test 4: Check ERR and ERL values
ERR =11(division by zero)
ERL =440(should be 440)

Test 5: ON ERROR GOTO 0 (disable)
No error: 10 / 2 = 5 

Test 6: Count multiple errors
Errors caught: 3 

Error handling tests complete!
