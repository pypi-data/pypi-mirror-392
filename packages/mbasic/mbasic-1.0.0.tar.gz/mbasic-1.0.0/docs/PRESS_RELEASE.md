## The Breakthrough You've Been Waiting For

MBASIC 2025 isn't just another BASIC interpreter. It's a **complete implementation** of Microsoft BASIC-80 5.21 with features that will blow your mind:

✨ **ZERO Installation Required** — Point your browser at https://mbasic.awohl.com and start coding IMMEDIATELY!

✨ **100% Language Compatibility** — Every statement, every function, every quirk of the original MBASIC 5.21 — implemented to perfection!

✨ **THREE Complete Implementations** — Run programs in the interpreter OR compile to native CP/M executables for 8080/Z80 hardware OR compile to JavaScript for modern browsers and Node.js. That's right — REAL machine code for vintage hardware AND modern JavaScript!

✨ **Four Ways to Work** — Choose your interface: Web browser, full-screen terminal (Curses), graphical desktop (Tkinter), or classic command-line. Your choice. Your way.

✨ **Hardware Access That Actually Works** — PEEK, POKE, INP, OUT, WAIT, CALL, USR — these aren't just parsed, they generate REAL 8080/Z80 assembly code in compiled programs!

## What Makes MBASIC 2025 Different?

### We Didn't Cut Corners. We Didn't Skip Features. We Built It RIGHT.

**100% MBASIC 5.21 Compatibility:** All 63 statements. All 40 functions. All data types. Error handling. File I/O. Random access files. String manipulation. Mathematical functions. We implemented EVERYTHING.

**The Compilers Actually Compile:** Unlike other projects that gave up on the "hard parts," we have TWO production-ready compilers:
- **Z80/8080 Backend:** Generates real CP/M .COM executables with full hardware access. PEEK reads memory. POKE writes memory. INP reads I/O ports. These aren't stubs — they're the real deal!
- **JavaScript Backend:** Generates clean, portable JavaScript that runs in modern browsers and Node.js. Perfect for web deployment, teaching, and cross-platform BASIC applications!

**Documentation Beyond Belief:** Over **1 MILLION WORDS** of documentation. Every statement explained. Every function documented. Step-by-step tutorials. Developer guides. Architecture documentation. We didn't just build it — we documented every single piece!

**Browse Documentation Online:** https://avwohl.github.io/mbasic/ — Complete language reference, UI guides, compiler documentation, and 113 ready-to-run vintage BASIC programs!

## The Compiler Story: Hardware Access That Actually Works

Most BASIC compilers skip the hard parts. They'll compile your FOR loops and IF statements, but when you try to use PEEK, POKE, INP, OUT, WAIT, CALL, or USR — suddenly it's "not supported" or "interpreter only."

**Not MBASIC 2025.**

Our compiler generates REAL machine code for hardware access:

```basic
10 REM This actually works in compiled code!
20 A = PEEK(100)         ' Read memory address 100
30 POKE 100, 42          ' Write byte to memory
40 B = INP(255)          ' Read I/O port 255
50 OUT 255, 1            ' Write to I/O port
60 WAIT 255, 1           ' Wait for port bit
70 CALL 16384            ' Execute machine code
80 ADDR = VARPTR(A)      ' Get variable address
90 RESULT = USR(16384)   ' Call ML subroutine
```

Compile this. Run it on CP/M. **It just works.**
