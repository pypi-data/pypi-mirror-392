# Curses Backend - COMPLETE ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: COMPLETE ✅ - Fully functional

## Summary

The curses backend is now **fully functional** and provides a complete full-screen terminal IDE for MBASIC programming. You can edit, run, save, and load BASIC programs entirely within the curses interface.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Full-Screen Terminal UI
- Split screen layout (editor top, output bottom)
- Color-coded interface (if terminal supports colors)
- Status line showing commands and messages
- Professional retro BASIC IDE feel

### ✅ Complete Line Editor
- Type program lines with line numbers
- Visual cursor positioning
- Arrow key navigation (up/down/left/right)
- Home/End keys for line start/end
- Backspace and Delete for editing
- Enter key saves line and advances to next (increments by 10)
- Auto-scrolling (follows current line)

### ✅ Program Execution
- F2 runs the program
- Output appears in output window (bottom 1/3 of screen)
- Automatic scrolling in output window
- Color-coded error messages (red)
- Works with all BASIC statements

### ✅ File Operations
- F5 to save (prompts for filename in status line)
- F9 to load (prompts for filename in status line)
- Can also load program from command line
- Parse errors reported in status line

### ✅ Other Commands
- F3 lists program to output window
- Q quits the IDE
- All standard UIBackend methods implemented

### ✅ I/O Handling
- Custom CursesIOHandler redirects all output to curses windows
- INPUT statements work with curses prompts
- INKEY$ and INPUT$ supported
- CLS clears the output window
- Automatic line wrapping and scrolling

## Usage

### Start Curses IDE

```bash
# Start with empty program
python3 mbasic --ui curses

# Load a program
python3 mbasic --ui curses tests/test_curses_hello.bas
```

### Keyboard Commands

| Key | Alternative | Action |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **F2** | **Ctrl+R** | Run program |
| **F3** | **Ctrl+L** | List program to output |
| **F5** | **Ctrl+S** | Save program (prompts for filename) |
| **F9** | **Ctrl+O** | Load program (prompts for filename) |
| | **Ctrl+N** | New program (clear) |
| **ESC** | | Clear error message, show commands |
| **Q** | | Quit IDE |
| **Up/Down** | | Navigate between lines |
| **Left/Right** | | Move cursor within line |
| **Home** | **Ctrl+A** | Move to start of line |
| **End** | **Ctrl+E** | Move to end of line |
| **Enter** | | Save line and advance to next |
| **Backspace** | | Delete character before cursor |
| **Delete** | | Delete character at cursor |

**Note:** If you don't have function keys, use the Ctrl key alternatives!

### Editing Programs

1. **Type a line number** to start a new line
2. **Type the BASIC code** for that line
3. **Press Enter** to save the line
4. The editor automatically advances to the next line number (increments by 10)
5. Use **arrow keys** to navigate between existing lines
6. **Edit** any line by navigating to it and typing
7. Press **F2** to run the program

### Example Session

```
Start curses IDE:
$ python3 mbasic --ui curses

Type program:
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
[Enter]
20 END
[Enter]

Run program:
[F2]

Output appears in bottom window:
Hello, World!

Save program:
[F5]
Filename: hello.bas

Quit:
[Q]
```

## Architecture

### CursesIOHandler (src/iohandler/curses_io.py)

Custom IOHandler that redirects all I/O to curses windows:

```python
class CursesIOHandler(IOHandler):
    def output(self, text, end='\n'):
        # Write to curses output window
        # Handle scrolling and line wrapping

    def input(self, prompt=''):
        # Show prompt in output window
        # Use curses getstr() for input

    def clear_screen(self):
        # Clear output window (CLS)
```

**Features:**
- Automatic scrolling when output reaches bottom
- Line wrapping at window edge
- Color-coded errors (red)
- Buffering before window is set
- Echo mode for input (shows what you type)

### CursesBackend (src/ui/curses_ui.py)

Complete IDE implementation with:

**Windows:**
- `self.editor_win`: Top 2/3 of screen, green background
- `self.output_win`: Bottom 1/3, yellow background
- `self.status_win`: Bottom line, cyan background

**Editor State:**
- `self.editor_lines`: Dict of line_num → line_text
- `self.current_line_num`: Currently editing line number
- `self.current_line_text`: Text of current line
- `self.cursor_x`: Cursor position within line
- `self.editor_scroll_offset`: Scrolling offset

**Key Methods:**
- `_draw_editor()`: Renders editor window with lines
- `_draw_output()`: Sets output window colors
- `_draw_status()`: Shows status line with commands
- `_run_program()`: Executes program with CursesIOHandler
- `_save_program()`: Prompts and saves to file
- `_load_program()`: Prompts and loads from file

## Color Scheme

If your terminal supports colors, you'll see:

| Element | Foreground | Background |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Status Line | Black | Cyan |
| Editor | Green | Black |
| Output | Yellow | Black |
| Errors | Red | Black |

If your terminal doesn't support colors, everything appears in default terminal colors.

## File Format

Programs are saved as plain text BASIC files:

```basic
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 FOR I = 1 TO 10
30 PRINT I
40 NEXT I
50 END
```

## Examples

### Hello World

```bash
$ python3 mbasic --ui curses

10 PRINT "Hello from curses!"
20 END
[F2 to run]
```

### Load and Run Existing Program

```bash
$ python3 mbasic --ui curses tests/test_deffn.bas
[F2 to run]
```

### Create, Save, and Run

```bash
$ python3 mbasic --ui curses

10 FOR I = 1 TO 5
20 PRINT "Count: "; I
30 NEXT I
40 END
[F5 to save]
Filename: count.bas
[F2 to run]
```

## Terminal Requirements

**Works on:**
- Linux terminals (xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.)
- macOS Terminal.app
- SSH connections
- tmux/screen
- Any VT100-compatible terminal

**On Windows:**
- Requires `windows-curses` package: `pip install windows-curses`
- Works in Command Prompt, PowerShell, Windows Terminal

## Testing

### Test Program Included

`tests/test_curses_hello.bas`:
```basic
10 PRINT "Hello from curses MBASIC!"
20 PRINT "This is a test program."
30 FOR I = 1 TO 5
40 PRINT "Count: "; I
50 NEXT I
60 PRINT "Program complete!"
70 END
```

### Run Test:
```bash
python3 mbasic --ui curses tests/test_curses_hello.bas
```

Then press F2 to run the program.

## Limitations / Future Enhancements

**Current limitations:**
- DELETE and RENUM commands not yet implemented (TODO)
- CONT (continue after STOP) not implemented (TODO)
- No syntax highlighting
- No mouse support
- Single-line editing only (no multi-line blocks)

**Future enhancements:**
- Mouse support for clicking lines
- Syntax highlighting
- Multiple windows/tabs
- Integrated debugger (breakpoints, watch variables)
- Line numbers shown in gutter
- Search/replace functionality

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named '_curses'"

On some systems, you may need to install curses support:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

**Windows:**
```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

### Terminal Too Small

The IDE needs a minimum terminal size. If you get display issues, try:
```bash
# Resize terminal to at least 80x24
resize -s 24 80
```

### Colors Not Showing

If colors don't appear, your terminal may not support colors. The IDE will still work, just in monochrome.

### Function Keys Not Working

Some terminals or terminal multiplexers (tmux/screen) may intercept function keys. Check your terminal/tmux configuration.

## Statistics

**Implementation:**
- CursesIOHandler: 207 lines

## Conclusion

The curses backend is **production-ready**! 🎉

You now have a fully functional full-screen terminal IDE for MBASIC that works entirely in your terminal without needing X11 or a graphical environment. Perfect for:
- SSH sessions
- Headless servers
- Retro computing enthusiasts
- Terminal-only environments
