"""
GenAI Application entity for organizing and managing GenAI application resources in Fiddler.

The Application class represents a logical container for organizing related GenAI application
resources including datasets, experiments, evaluators, and monitoring configurations. Applications
provide isolation, access control, and organizational structure for GenAI App monitoring workflows
within a project context.

Key Concepts:
    - **Project Container**: Applications are contained within projects and inherit project-level settings
    - **Resource Organization**: Applications group related GenAI resources and configurations
    - **Access Control**: Applications can have different permissions and access levels within projects
    - **Lifecycle Management**: Applications coordinate the lifecycle of contained resources

Common Workflow:
    1. Create or retrieve a project for your GenAI use case
    2. Create applications within the project using Application.create()
    3. Add datasets, evaluators, and monitoring configurations to the application
    4. Manage application-level settings and access permissions

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # Create a new application within a project
        application = Application.create(name="fraud_detection_app", project_id=project_id)

Note:
    Application names must be unique within a project. Applications cannot be renamed
    after creation, but can be deleted if no longer needed.

class Application(BaseEntity):
    """Represents a GenAI Application container for organizing GenAI application resources.

    An Application is a logical container within a Project that groups related GenAI
    application resources including datasets, experiments, evaluators, and monitoring
    configurations. Applications provide resource organization, access control, and
    lifecycle management for GenAI App monitoring workflows.

    Key Features:
        - **Resource Organization**: Container for related GenAI application resources
        - **Project Context**: Applications are scoped within projects for isolation
        - **Access Management**: Application-level permissions and access control
        - **Monitoring Coordination**: Centralized monitoring and alerting configuration
        - **Lifecycle Management**: Coordinated creation, updates, and deletion of resources

    Application Lifecycle:
        1. **Creation**: Create application with unique name within a project
        2. **Configuration**: Set up datasets, evaluators, and monitoring
        3. **Operations**: Publish logs, monitor performance, manage alerts
        4. **Maintenance**: Update configurations and resources
        5. **Cleanup**: Delete application when no longer needed

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # Create a new application for fraud detection
            application = Application.create(name="fraud-detection-app", project_id=project_id)
            print(f"Created application: {application.name} (ID: {application.id})")

    Note:
        Applications are permanent containers - once created, the name cannot be changed.
        Deleting an application removes all contained resources and configurations.
        Consider the organizational structure carefully before creating applications.
