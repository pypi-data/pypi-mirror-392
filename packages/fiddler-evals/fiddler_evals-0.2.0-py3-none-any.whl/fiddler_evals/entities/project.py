"""
Project entity for organizing and managing GenAI Apps in Fiddler.

The Project class represents a logical container for organizing related GenAI Applications,
evaluation datasets, experiments and monitoring configurations. Projects provide isolation,
access control, and organizational structure for LLM/GenAI Apps offline and online monitoring workflows.

Key Concepts:
    - **Organization**: Projects group related GenAI Apps and resources together
    - **Isolation**: Each project maintains separate namespaces for GenAI Apps and data
    - **Access Control**: Projects can have different permissions and access levels
    - **Lifecycle Management**: Projects coordinate the lifecycle of contained resources

Common Workflow:
    1. Create or retrieve a project for your LLM/GenAI use case
    2. Add an application to the project using Application.create()
    3. Evaluate your LLM/Agent/App using evaluate()
    4. Manage project-level settings and access permissions

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        # Create a new project
        project = Project.create(name="fraud_detection")

Note:
    Project names must be unique within an organization and follow slug-like naming
    conventions (lowercase, hyphens, underscores allowed). Projects cannot be renamed
    after creation, but can be deleted if no longer needed.

    """Represents a project container for organizing GenAI Apps and resources.

    A Project is the top-level organizational unit in Fiddler that groups related
    GenAI Applications, datasets, and monitoring configurations. Projects provide
    logical separation, access control, and resource management for GenAI App monitoring workflows.

    Key Features:
        - **GenAI Apps Organization**: Container for related GenAI apps
        - **Resource Isolation**: Separate namespaces prevent naming conflicts
        - **Access Management**: Project-level permissions and access control
        - **Monitoring Coordination**: Centralized monitoring and alerting configuration
        - **Lifecycle Management**: Coordinated creation, updates, and deletion of resources

    Project Lifecycle:
        1. **Creation**: Create project with unique name within organization
        2. **App creation**: Create GenAI applications with Application().create()
        3. **Configuration**: Set up monitoring, alerts, and evaluators.
        4. **Operations**: Publish logs, monitor performance, manage alerts
        5. **Maintenance**: Update configurations
        6. **Cleanup**: Delete project when no longer needed (removes all contained resources)

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            # Create a new project for fraud detection models
            project = Project.create(name="fraud-detection-2024")
            print(f"Created project: {project.name} (ID: {project.id})")

    Note:
        Projects are permanent containers - once created, the name cannot be changed.
        Deleting a project removes all contained models, datasets, and configurations.
        Consider the organizational structure carefully before creating projects.
