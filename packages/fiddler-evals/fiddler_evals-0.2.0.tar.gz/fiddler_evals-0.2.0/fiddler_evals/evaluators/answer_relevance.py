class AnswerRelevance(FiddlerLLMAAJEvaluator):
    """Evaluator to assess how well an answer addresses a given question.

    The AnswerRelevance evaluator measures whether an LLM's answer is relevant
    and directly addresses the question being asked. This is a critical metric
    for ensuring that LLM responses stay on topic and provide meaningful value
    to users.

    Key Features:
        - **Relevance Assessment**: Determines if the answer directly addresses the question
        - **Binary Scoring**: Returns 1.0 for relevant answers, 0.0 for irrelevant ones
        - **Detailed Reasoning**: Provides explanation for the relevance assessment
        - **Fiddler API Integration**: Uses Fiddler's built-in relevance evaluation model

    Use Cases:
        - **Q&A Systems**: Ensuring answers stay on topic
        - **Customer Support**: Verifying responses address user queries
        - **Educational Content**: Checking if explanations answer the question
        - **Research Assistance**: Validating that responses are relevant to queries

    Scoring Logic:
        - **1.0 (Relevant)**: Answer directly addresses the question with relevant information
        - **0.0 (Irrelevant)**: Answer doesn't address the question or goes off-topic

    Args:
        prompt (str): The question being asked.
        response (str): The LLM's response to evaluate.

    Returns:
        Score: A Score object containing:
            - value: 1.0 if relevant, 0.0 if irrelevant
            - label: String representation of the boolean result
            - reasoning: Detailed explanation of the assessment

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from fiddler_evals.evaluators import AnswerRelevance
            evaluator = AnswerRelevance()

            # Relevant answer
            score = evaluator.score(
                prompt="What is the capital of France?",
                response="The capital of France is Paris."
            )
            print(f"Relevance: {score.value}")  # 1.0
            print(f"Reasoning: {score.reasoning}")

            # Irrelevant answer
            score = evaluator.score(
                prompt="What is the capital of France?",
                response="I like pizza and Italian food."
            )
            print(f"Relevance: {score.value}")  # 0.0

    Note:
        This evaluator uses Fiddler's built-in relevance assessment model
        and requires an active connection to the Fiddler API.
