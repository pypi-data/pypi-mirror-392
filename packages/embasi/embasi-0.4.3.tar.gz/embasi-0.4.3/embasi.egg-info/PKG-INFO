# EmbASI

EmbASI is a python-based wrapper for QM/QM embedding simulations using the ASI (Atomic Simulation Interface). The wrapper handles communication between QM code library calls through C-based callbacks, and imports/exports relevant matices such as density matrices and hamiltonians required for embedding schemes such as Projection-Based Embedding (PbE). Atomic information is communicated through Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) atoms objects.

# Supported QM Pakage(s)
