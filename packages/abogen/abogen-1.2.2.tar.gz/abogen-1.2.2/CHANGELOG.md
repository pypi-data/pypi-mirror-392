# 1.2.2
- **You can now voice your subtitle files!** Simply add `.srt`, `.ass` or `.vtt` files to generate timed audio. Alternatively, add a text file with timestamps in `HH:MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS,ms` format to generate audio that matches the timestamps. See [here](https://github.com/denizsafak/abogen?tab=readme-ov-file#about-timestamp-based-text-files) for detailed instructions.
    - New option: **"Use silent gaps between subtitles"**: Prevents unnecessary audio speed-up by letting speech continue into the silent gaps between subtitles.
    - New option: **"Subtitle speed adjustment method"**: Choose how to speed up audio when needed:
        - **TTS Regeneration (better quality):** Re-generates the audio at a faster speed for more natural sound.
        - **FFmpeg Time-stretch (better speed):** Quickly speeds up the generated audio.
