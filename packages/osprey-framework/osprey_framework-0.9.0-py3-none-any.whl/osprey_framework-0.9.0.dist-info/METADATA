# Osprey Framework

> **🚧 Early Access Release**
> This is an early access version of the Osprey Framework. While the core functionality is stable and ready for experimentation, documentation and APIs may still evolve. We welcome feedback and contributions!

An open-source, domain-agnostic, capability-based architecture for building intelligent agents that can be adapted to any specific domain.

**📄 Research**
This work was presented as a contributed oral presentation at [ICALEPCS'25](https://indico.jacow.org/event/86/overview) and will be featured at the [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2025/) at NeurIPS 2025.


## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the framework
pip install osprey-framework

# Recommended: Interactive setup (guides you through everything!)
osprey

# The interactive menu will:
# - Help you choose a template with descriptions
# - Guide you through AI provider and model selection
# - Automatically detect and configure API keys from your environment
# - Create a ready-to-use project with smart defaults

# Alternative: Direct command if you know what you want
osprey init my-weather-agent --template hello_world_weather
cd my-weather-agent
# If API keys aren't in your environment, copy and edit .env:
# cp .env.example .env

# Start the command line chat interface
osprey chat
```
