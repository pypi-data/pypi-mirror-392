# handsfreed

`handsfreed` is a local, real-time speech-to-text daemon for Linux. It uses the `faster-whisper` library to provide high-quality, offline transcription.

This package is the daemon component of the [Handsfree](https://github.com/achyudh/handsfree) project. It is controlled by the [`handsfreectl`](https://crates.io/crates/handsfreectl) command-line tool.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

`handsfreed` requires `PortAudio`, which is a dependency of the `sounddevice` Python library. You must install the `PortAudio` library and its development headers using your system's package manager.

*   **Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev
    ```

*   **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install portaudio-devel
    ```

*   **Arch Linux:**
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S portaudio
    ```

Once the system dependencies are installed, you can install `handsfreed` using `pip`:

```bash
