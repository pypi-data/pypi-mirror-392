# delta-trace-db

Python implementation of DeltaTraceDB.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of server-side code:  
[ServerSide Example](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_db_py_server_example)  

For more information, see the [online documentation](https://masahidemori-simpleappli.github.io/delta_trace_db_docs/).

I am also developing an open source editor for manually editing the DB contents:  
[DeltaTraceStudio](https://github.com/MasahideMori-SimpleAppli/delta_trace_studio)  

## Speed

This package is an in-memory database, so it is generally fast.  
Currently, there is no mechanism to speed it up, but it works almost the same as a for loop in a program,  
so there is usually no problem with around 100,000 records.  
I recommend that you test it in an actual environment using test_speed.py in the test folder.  
However, since it consumes RAM capacity according to the amount of data,  
if you need an extremely large database, consider using a general database.  
For reference, below are the results of a speed test (tests/test_speed.py) run on a slightly  
older PC equipped with a Ryzen 3600 CPU.  
The test conditions were chosen to take a sufficiently long time, but I think it will rarely
cause   
any problems in practical use.
Please note that speeds also depend on the amount of data, so if you have a lot of large data, it will be slower.

```text
tests/test_speed.py speed test for 100000 records
start add
end add: 339 ms
start getAll (with object convert)
end getAll: 659 ms
returnsLength: 100000
start save (with json string convert)
end save: 467 ms
start load (with json string convert)
end load: 558 ms
start search (with object convert)
end search: 866 ms
returnsLength: 100000
start search paging, half limit pre search (with object convert)
end search paging: 425 ms
returnsLength: 50000
start searchOne, the last index object search (with object convert)
end searchOne: 38 ms
returnsLength: 1
start update at half index and last index object
end update: 90 ms
start updateOne of half index object
end updateOne: 16 ms
start conformToTemplate
end conformToTemplate: 82 ms
start delete half object (with object convert)
end delete: 621 ms
returnsLength: 50000
start deleteOne for last object (with object convert)
end deleteOne: 22 ms
returnsLength: 1
start add with serialKey
end add with serialKey: 98 ms
addedCount:100000
```

## Future plans

It is possible to speed up the database, but this is a low priority, so I think that improving
usability and creating peripheral tools will take priority.

## Notes

This package is primarily designed for single-threaded operation.  
Unlike the Dart version, most methods within the DeltaTraceDatabase class acquire an RLock and can be called in
multi-threaded mode, but other classes and utility functions are not thread-safe, 
so care must be taken when using them in parallel.
Additionally, for parallel processing that does not share memory (e.g., across processes), message passing or similar 
mechanisms are required, just like in the Dart version.  


## Support

There is essentially no support at this time, but bugs will likely be fixed.  
If you find any issues, please open an issue on GitHub.

## About version control

The C part will be changed at the time of version upgrade.  
However, versions less than 1.0.0 may change the file structure regardless of the following rules.

- Changes such as adding variables, structure change that cause problems when reading previous
  files.
    - C.X.X
- Adding methods, etc.
    - X.C.X
- Minor changes and bug fixes.
    - X.X.C
