Annize is a Python-based framework for automating workflows. It allows users to define objects and tasks that refer to reusable Annize Features, which implement specific functionality. Features can be custom implementations or installed from external packages. Annize primarily serves as an execution engine, while most of the functionality comes from these modular Features.

Projects in Annize are defined using configuration files (usually XML), allowing tasks to be executed with various inputs. The Annize Studio provides an interface to conveniently configure objects, check for errors, and run tasks. It is designed for developers but can be adapted to a wide range of automation needs, offering flexibility for everything from simple to more complex workflows.
