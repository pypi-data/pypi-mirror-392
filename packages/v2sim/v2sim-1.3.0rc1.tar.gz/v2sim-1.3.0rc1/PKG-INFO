V2Sim family includes several open-source software for coupled urban power and transportation network. They are different in the transportation simulation part.

+ **V2Sim**: Use SUMO for **MICROSCOPIC** traffic simulation. It could identify the microscopic motion of a single vehicle, including its lane, speed, accerlation, etc. This version is suitable if your research concerns the implication of delicate motion of EVs on power grid. (Please scroll down to read instructions.)

+ **V2Sim-UX**: Use uxsim for **MESOCOPIC** traffic simulation. It runs very fast with free-threading Python (3.14+). This version is suitable if your research need fast iterations and focus on the overall implication of the traffic flow. (Link: [V2Sim-UX](https://github.com/hesl-seu/v2sim/tree/uxsim))

## V2Sim: The Microscopic Version

V2Sim is a microscopic V2G simulation platform in urban power and transportation network. It is open-source under BSD license. 

+ **Note**: Current code of V2Sim is ahead of the paper described. The exact older code used in the paper is [here](https://github.com/fmy-xfk/v2sim/commit/940ebd5d988f53fde90f4d83d107f136334952f9). The code used in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09808) is the initial commit.

+ **Note 2**: Code of PDN part is not included in the repository, it is stored in another repository: [FPowerKit](https://gitee.com/fmy_xfk/fpowerkit).
