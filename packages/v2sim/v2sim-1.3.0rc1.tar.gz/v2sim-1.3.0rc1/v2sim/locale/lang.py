The series name should be in the format of "<results>:<attribute>:<instances>:<starting_time>", where
    "results" is the result folder, 
    "attribute" is the attribute to be plotted,
    "instances" is the instance name, such as

        etc.,
    "starting_time" is the starting time of the series. "0" by default. This is optional.
