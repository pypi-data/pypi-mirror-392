best_practices:
  - "Use provisioned concurrency for predictable performance"
  - "Implement proper timeout and error handling"
  - "Use X-Ray for distributed tracing"
  - "Monitor cold start performance"

cost_optimization:
  - "Use Lambda Power Tuning for optimal memory allocation"
  - "Implement request throttling"
  - "Use reserved concurrency for critical functions"
