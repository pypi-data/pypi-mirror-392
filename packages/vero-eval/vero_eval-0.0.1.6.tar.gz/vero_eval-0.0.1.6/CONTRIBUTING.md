## 🧩 How to Contribute

We follow the **Fork → Branch → Pull Request (PR)** workflow (visual guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).

1. **Fork** this repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-feature # give any name you want;)
4. Create a **virtual environment using Python 3.12** (We recommend using uv to create venv and installing dependencies):
   ```bash
   uv venv .venv --python 3.12   #if using python : python -m venv venv
   source venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
   ```
5. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   
6. Follow existing **code patterns** and include a clear **docstring** and references.

7. **Commit and push** your changes to your fork.

8. Open a **Pull Request** against the main branch with a clear title and description.
