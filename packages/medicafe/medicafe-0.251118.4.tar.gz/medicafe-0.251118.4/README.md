# MediCafe

MediCafe is a small toolkit that helps automate common Medisoft admin tasks. It has two parts:

- MediBot: automates routine data handling
- MediLink: moves claims and responses between payers and your system

The focus is simple: reduce manual steps, add reliable checks, and keep logs that make issues easy to trace.

## Features
- Command-line entry point: `medicafe`
- Basic claim routing and status checks
- Lightweight utilities for importing, validation, and file handling
- Works on older Python 3.4 installs and modern environments

## Install
Use pip:

```
pip install medicafe
```

If you are on a system with managed Python, you may need a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install medicafe
```

## Gmail Pipeline Setup

For complete Gmail email ingestion pipeline setup:

```
cd cloud/orchestrator
.\setup_complete_pipeline.ps1           # Complete pipeline setup
```

For Gmail monitoring tools:

```
cd tools
.\pipeline_status.ps1 -Action status    # Check pipeline status
.\pipeline_status.ps1 -Action verify    # Full verification
