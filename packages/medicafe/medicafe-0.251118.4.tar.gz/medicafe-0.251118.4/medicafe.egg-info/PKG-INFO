# MediCafe

MediCafe is a small toolkit that helps automate common Medisoft admin tasks. It has two parts:

- MediBot: automates routine data handling
- MediLink: moves claims and responses between payers and your system

The focus is simple: reduce manual steps, add reliable checks, and keep logs that make issues easy to trace.

## Features
- Command-line entry point: `medicafe`
- Basic claim routing and status checks
- Lightweight utilities for importing, validation, and file handling
- Works on older Python 3.4 installs and modern environments

## Install
Use pip:

```
pip install medicafe
```

If you are on a system with managed Python, you may need a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install medicafe
```

## Gmail Pipeline Setup

For complete Gmail email ingestion pipeline setup:

```
cd cloud/orchestrator
.\setup_complete_pipeline.ps1           # Complete pipeline setup
```

For Gmail monitoring tools:

```
cd tools
.\pipeline_status.ps1 -Action status    # Check pipeline status
.\pipeline_status.ps1 -Action verify    # Full verification
.\setup_gmail_watch.ps1                 # Setup Gmail monitoring
```

**New Setup?** See `cloud/orchestrator/FRESH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete setup instructions.

See `tools/README.md` for detailed tool documentation.

## Quick start
Run the main entry point:

```
medicafe --help
```

Or from Python:

```
python3 -m MediCafe --help
```

Common tasks:
- Download payer emails
- Submit or check claim status
- Run MediLink workflows

## Compatibility
- Python: 3.4+ (tested with legacy constraints), also runs on newer Python
- OS: Windows or Linux

## Project goals
- Keep the code straightforward and readable
- Respect older environments where needed
- Fail with clear, actionable messages
