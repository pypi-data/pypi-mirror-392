### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
5. **Ensure code quality**:
   ```bash
   make format
   make lint
   ```
6. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages
7. **Push to your fork** and open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- (Optional) Docker for running the development environment

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/baselinr.git
   cd baselinr
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   make venv
   # Activate it:
   # Windows: .\activate.ps1
   # Linux/Mac: source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

4. **Install git hooks** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   make install-hooks
   ```

5. **Start development environment** (optional):
   ```bash
   make docker-up
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use:
- **Black** for code formatting (line length: 100)
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking (where applicable)

Run formatting and linting:
```bash
make format  # Formats code with black and isort
make lint    # Runs flake8 and mypy
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass: `make test`
- Aim for good test coverage
- Tests are located in the `tests/` directory

### Type Hints

- Add type hints to function signatures
- Use type hints for complex data structures
- We use Python 3.10+ type hint syntax

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to public functions and classes
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory
- Keep examples up to date

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Ensure all checks pass**:
   - Tests pass
   - Code is formatted
   - Linters pass
   - CI checks pass

3. **Write a clear PR description**:
   - What changes were made
   - Why the changes were made
   - How to test the changes
   - Any breaking changes

4. **Link related issues** in the PR description

5. **Wait for review** - maintainers will review your PR

6. **Address feedback** - make requested changes and push updates

## Adding a New Database Connector

1. Create a new file in `baselinr/connectors/` (e.g., `newdb.py`)
2. Inherit from `BaseConnector` in `connectors/base.py`
3. Implement required methods
4. Add to `connectors/__init__.py`
5. Update `DatabaseType` enum in `config/schema.py`
6. Add tests in `tests/`
7. Update documentation

See `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed examples.

## Adding a New Metric

1. Add metric calculation logic to `profiling/metrics.py`
2. Add metric name to configuration schema
3. Add tests
4. Update documentation

## Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: Add support for MySQL connector
fix: Handle null values in drift detection
docs: Update installation instructions
test: Add tests for incremental profiling
refactor: Simplify configuration loading
```
