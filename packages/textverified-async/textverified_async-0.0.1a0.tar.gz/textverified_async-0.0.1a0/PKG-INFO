# Unofficial Textverified API client in Python #

## в„№пёЏ About the Project
<b>This library is designed to access the <a href="https://www.textverified.com/docs/api/v2#overview">TextVerified API</a> using an asynchronous Python client.</b>

---

## рџЏЋ The difference between the official and my code
рџђў <a href = "https://pypi.org/project/textverified/">The official Python client</a> uses a <b>slow http.client</b>, and also stops the main stream (for example, the client.sms.incoming function)


рџљЂ My client uses <b>aiohttp</b> as a request handler, and also has support for <i>create_task</i> and <i>gather</i> processes without blocking the main flow.


рџ”ђ This client also supports <b>Bearer tokens</b> and automatically generates them after they expire for secure access to the API (just like the official client, but <b>faster</b>)

## рџ’» Installation
Library download is recommended for Python >= 3.9

```
pip install textverified_async
```

## рџ›  Usage
Current available methods:

- [x] Account Info
- [x] Bearer Token
- [ ] Service List
- [ ] Sales
- [ ] Billing Cycles
- [ ] Back order rental reservation
- [x] List Reservations
- [ ] Verifications (Soon)
- [ ] New Rental / Verification
- [x] Renewable Rentals
- [x] NonRenewable Rentals
- [x] SMS
- [ ] Calls and Voices
- [x] Wake Requests
- [ ] Webhook
- [ ] Legacy

There is no documentation yet, but it is quite easy to use.
You can also hold down CTRL on the client and view the available functions and models, or get the current mini-documentation by hovering over the function.

Import the library

```python
from textverified_async.api import TextVerifiedApi
```

Then create an API class (it will automatically create a session and token)

```python
api = TextVerifiedApi(вЂњapi-keyвЂќ, вЂњusernameвЂќ)
```

Next, you can safely use commands from the API using its class

For example:
```python
info = await api.get_account_info()
```

### Note: If you want to get the information you need right away, put the asynchronous function in parentheses ###
Example:
```python
balance = (await api.get_account_info()).currentBalance
```

All responses from the API will have the same value as in Textverified REST.API

## рџ“‹ Example
Here is an example of code for using the client (you will also see this code in the api.py class of the library):

```python
from textverified_async.api import TextVerifiedApi

# Usage
async def main():
    api = TextVerifiedApi(вЂњapiвЂќ, вЂњmailвЂќ)
    
    await api.generate_bearer ()
    status = await api.check_token_status()
    print(fвЂњToken status: {status}вЂќ)

    try:
        # Get all rented numbers
        all_rentals = await api.get_rentals()
        print(fвЂњFound {len(all_rentals)} rentals:вЂќ)

        for rental in all_rentals:
            print(fвЂњ- {rental.serviceName}: {rental.number} ({rental.state})вЂќ)
                
        # Example of getting detailed information about a specific number
        if all_rentals:
            first_rental = all_rentals[0]
            print(fвЂњ\nGetting details for rental: {first_rental.id}вЂќ)

            rental_details = await api.get_rental_by_id(first_rental.id)

			print(fвЂњDetailed info for {rental_details.number}:вЂќ)
			print(fвЂњ  Service: {rental_details.serviceName}вЂќ)
			print(fвЂњ  State: {rental_details.state}вЂќ)
            print(fвЂњ  Always on: {rental_details.alwaysOn}вЂќ)
            print(fвЂњ  Can refund: {rental_details.refund.canRefund}вЂќ)
            print(fвЂњ  Billing cycle ID: {rental_details.billingCycleId}вЂќ)

        wake = await api.wake_up_reservation(first_rental.id)
        print(fвЂњ\nWoke up {wake.usageWindowStart} | Woke down {wake.usageWindowEnd} with wake ID {wake.id}вЂќ)
                
    except Exception as e:
        print(fвЂњError: {e}вЂќ)


if __name__ == вЂњ__main__вЂќ:
    asyncio.run(main())
```
