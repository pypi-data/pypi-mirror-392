### Changed

* Removed `BlockSize` in `make_kernel` and `CShuffleEpilogueProblem` to support Wave32 in CK_TILE (#2594)
* Added an optional template parameter `Arch` (`gfx9_t`, `gfx12_t` etc.) to `make_kernel` to support linking multiple object files that have the same kernel compiled for different architectures.
