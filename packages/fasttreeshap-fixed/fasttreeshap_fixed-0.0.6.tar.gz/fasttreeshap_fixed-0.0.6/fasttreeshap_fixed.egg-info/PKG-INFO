FastTreeSHAP fork with critical fixes for modern environments. Includes XGBoost 2.0+ compatibility (handles string feature names), NumPy 2.0+ compatibility, and additivity bug fixes. FastTreeSHAP v1 is 1.5x faster than TreeSHAP, and FastTreeSHAP v2 is 2.5x faster than TreeSHAP. This fork ensures reliability in production Databricks and modern Python environments.
