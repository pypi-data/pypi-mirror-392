# IPyClient(indihost="localhost", indiport=7624, **clientdata)
#      This class can be used to create your own scripts or client, and provides
#      a connection to an INDI service, with parsing of the XML protocol.
#      You should create your own class, inheriting from this, and overriding the
#      rxevent method.
#      The argument clientdata provides any named arguments you may wish to pass
#      into the object when instantiating it.
#      The IPyClient object is also a mapping of devicename to device object, which
#      is populated as devices and their vectors are learned from the INDI protocol.

# getfloat(value)
#      The INDI spec specifies several different number formats, given a number
#      in any of these formats, this returns a float.
#      If an error occurs while parsing the number, a TypeError exception is raised."""

# events: These are created as data is received, for example a setTextVector will be created when
#         the connected indi service sends a 'setTextVector' instruction.
#         VectorTimeOut, ConnectionMade, ConnectionLost and ClientEvent are exceptions to this,
#         and are generated by this client.
#         These events can be handled by overwriting the IPyClient.rxevent(self, event) method.
