Description: 
        # Python git diff clone
        
        This lib is an implementation of the `git diff` tool in Python using the Myers Difference algorithm.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        $ python diff.py case_one.txt case_two.txt 
        ```
        
        This will show the diff script to go from file A to file B. You can test out the command with the `case_one.txt` and `case_two.txt` files included in the repository.
        
        To have the command available at all times, make sure the script `diff.py` is executable and then include it in your `$PATH`.
        
        ## Analysis
        
        For an extended analysis, refer to the PDF in this repo titled "The Myers Difference Algorithm for Version Control Systems".
