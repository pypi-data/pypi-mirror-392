           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# CausalPy

A Python package focussing on causal inference in quasi-experimental settings. The package allows for sophisticated Bayesian model fitting methods to be used in addition to traditional OLS.

## Installation

To get the latest release:
```bash
pip install CausalPy
```

Alternatively, if you want the very latest version of the package you can install from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy.git
```

## Quickstart

```python
import causalpy as cp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import and process data
df = (
    cp.load_data("drinking")
    .rename(columns={"agecell": "age"})
    .assign(treated=lambda df_: df_.age > 21)
    )

# Run the analysis
result = cp.RegressionDiscontinuity(
    df,
    formula="all ~ 1 + age + treated",
    running_variable_name="age",
    model=cp.pymc_models.LinearRegression(),
    treatment_threshold=21,
    )

# Visualize outputs
fig, ax = result.plot();

# Get a results summary
result.summary()

plt.show()
```

## Roadmap

Plans for the repository can be seen in the [Issues](https://github.com/pymc-labs/CausalPy/issues).

## Features

CausalPy has a broad range of quasi-experimental methods for causal inference:

| Method	| Description |
|-|-|
| Synthetic control | Constructs a synthetic version of the treatment group from a weighted combination of control units. Used for causal inference in comparative case studies when a single unit is treated, and there are multiple control units.|
| Geographical lift | Measures the impact of an intervention in a specific geographic area by comparing it to similar areas without the intervention. Commonly used in marketing to assess regional campaigns. |
| ANCOVA | Analysis of Covariance combines ANOVA and regression to control for the effects of one or more quantitative covariates. Used when comparing group means while controlling for other variables. |
| Differences in Differences | Compares the changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. Used in observational studies to estimate causal effects by accounting for time trends. |
| Regression discontinuity | Identifies causal effects by exploiting a cutoff or threshold in an assignment variable. Used when treatment is assigned based on a threshold value of an observed variable, allowing comparison just above and below the cutoff. |
| Regression kink designs | Focuses on changes in the slope (kinks) of the relationship between variables rather than jumps at cutoff points. Used to identify causal effects when treatment intensity changes at a threshold. |
| Interrupted time series | Analyzes the effect of an intervention by comparing time series data before and after the intervention. Used when data is collected over time and an intervention occurs at a known point, allowing assessment of changes in level or trend. |
| Instrumental variable regression | Addresses endogeneity by using an instrument variable that is correlated with the endogenous explanatory variable but uncorrelated with the error term. Used when explanatory variables are correlated with the error term, providing consistent estimates of causal effects. |
| Inverse Propensity Score Weighting | Weights observations by the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment. Used in causal inference to create a synthetic sample where the treatment assignment is independent of measured covariates, helping to adjust for confounding variables in observational studies. |
