    r"""
    Test for differences between leaf partitions.

    For each requested observation key, this function compares the set of leaves
    descended from each internal node (group1) to the set of leaves defined by
    the `comparison` parameter (group2):

    * ``comparison='siblings':``
        Compare to the descendants of sibling nodes. When there is more than one sibling (i.e., a non-binary split),
        each child node is compared individually to the pooled set of all other siblings.

    * ``comparison='rest':``
        Compare to all other leaves in the tree not descended from the given node.

    The `test` parameter defines how the two groups are compared:

    * ``test='permutation':``
        a two-sided permutation test is performed by repeatedly
        shuffling the pooled rows (group1 + group2), applying the ``aggregate`` function, and
        then recomputing the split statistic using the `metric` function.
        The number of permutations executed is the minimum of the user-requested
        ``n_permutations`` and the theoretical maximum number of distinct labelings (
        ``comb(n_left + n_right, n_left)``). The p-value is computed with standard
        +1 smoothing:

    .. math::

        p_\text{val} =
        \frac{
            \#\{\,|\mathrm{perm\_stat}| \ge |\mathrm{observed}|\,\} + 1
        }{
            N_\text{perm} + 1
        }

    * ``test='test-t':``
        a two-sided t-test is performed for each group. Note that for small numbers of leaves the p-value of this
        t-test can be unreliable.

    * ``test=None:``
        no statistical test is performed; only the partition statistic is computed.

    P-values are calculated as long as both groups have at least ``min_group_leaves`` leaves;
    otherwise, no test is performed for that partition and the p-value is set to NaN.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tdata
        TreeData object.
    keys
        One or more `obs.keys()`, `var_names`, `obsm.keys()`, or `obsp.keys()` to reconstruct.
    comparison
        Set of leaves to compare to:

        * 'siblings' : leaves descending from a given node are compared to leaves descending from its siblings.
        * 'rest' : leaves descending from a given node are compared to all other leaves of the tree.
    test
        Type of test to perform to compare the two groups. "t-test" can only be used for scalar keys.
    aggregate
        Function to reduce the data from all the leaves of a given group to a vector or scalar. Can be a known
        aggregator or a callable. Only used for test="permutation".
    metric
        A metric to compare the children from both sides of the tree. Can be a known metric or a callable. Only used
        for test="permutation".
    metric_kwds
        Options for the metric.
    equal_var
        Boolean indicating if the variance in the two groups should be assumed to be equal. Only used for
        test="t-test".
    n_permutations
        Upper bound on the number of permutations to run. The actually executed
        number is ``min(n_permutations, comb(n_left + n_right, n_left))`` per group.
    random_state
        Random seed to ensure reproducibility of permutation test.
    min_group_leaves
        Minimum number of leaves required in each group to perform a statistical test. The t-test may be particularly
        unreliable with small sample sizes.
    keys_added
        Attribute keys of `tdata.obst[tree].nodes` where group statistics will be stored. If `None`, `keys` are used.
    tree
        The `obst` key or keys of the trees to use. If `None`, all trees are used.
    copy
        If True, returns a :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>` with group statistics.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns `None` if `copy=False`, else returns :class:`DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>` with columns:
        - `'tree'` - Tree name.
        - `'key'` - Observation key.
        - `'parent'` - Parent of group1 node.
        - `'group1'` - Node defining group1 leaf set.
        - `'group2'` - Node(s) defining group2 leaf set or "rest".
        - `'value1'` - Aggregate leaf value for `group1`.
        - `'value2'` - Aggregate leaf value for `group2`.
        - `'pval'` - p-value from the statistical test (if performed).

    Sets the following fields:

    * `tdata.obst[tree].nodes[f"{key_added}_value"]` : `float`/:class:`ndarray <numpy.ndarray>`
        - Aggregate value of leaves descended from that node.
    * `tdata.obst[tree].edges[f"{key_added}_pval"]` : `float`
        - P-value for the partition test at that edge (if performed).
    * `tdata.obst[tree].edges[f"{key_added}_metric"]` : `float`
        - Metric value for the partition at that edge (only if test="permutation").
