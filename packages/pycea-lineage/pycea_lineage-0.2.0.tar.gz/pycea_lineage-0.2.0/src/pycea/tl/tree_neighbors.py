    """Identifies neighbors in the tree.

    For each leaf, this function identifies neighbors according to a chosen
    tree distance `metric` and either:

    * the top-``n_neighbors`` closest leaves (ties broken at random)

    * all leaves within a distance threshold ``max_dist``.

    Results are stored as sparse connectivities and distances, or returned when
    ``copy=True``. You can restrict the operation to a subset of leaves via
    ``obs`` and/or to specific trees via ``tree``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tdata
        The TreeData object.
    n_neighbors
        The number of neighbors to identify for each leaf. Ties are broken randomly.
    max_dist
        If n_neighbors is None, identify all neighbors within this distance.
    depth_key
        Attribute of `tdata.obst[tree].nodes` where depth is stored.
    obs
        The observations to use:

        - If `None`, neighbors for all leaves are stored in `tdata.obsp`.
        - If a string, neighbors of specified leaf are stored in `tdata.obs`.
        - If a sequence, neighbors within specified leaves are stored in `tdata.obsp`.
    metric
        The type of tree distance to compute:

        - `'lca'`: lowest common ancestor depth.
        - `'path'`: abs(node1 depth + node2 depth - 2 * lca depth).
    random_state
        Random seed for breaking ties.
    key_added
        Neighbor distances are stored in `tdata.obsp['{key_added}_distances']` and
        neighbors in .obsp['{key_added}_connectivities']. Defaults to 'tree'.
    update
        If True, updates existing distances instead of overwriting.
    tree
        The `tdata.obst` key or keys of the trees to use. If `None`, all trees are used.
    copy
        If True, returns a tuple of connectivities and distances.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns `None` if `copy=False`, else returns (connectivities, distances).

    Sets the following fields:

    * `tdata.obsp['{key_added}_distances']` : :class:`csr_matrix <scipy.sparse.csr_matrix>` (dtype `float`) if `obs` is `None` or a sequence.
        - Distances to neighboring observations.
    * `tdata.obsp['{key_added}_connectivities']` : :class:`csr_matrix <scipy.sparse.csr_matrix>` (dtype `float`) if distance is sparse.
        - Set of neighbors for each observation.
    * `tdata.obs['{key_added}_neighbors']` : :class:`Series <pandas.Series>` (dtype `bool`) if `obs` is a string.
        - Set of neighbors for specified observation.

    Examples
    --------
    Identify the 5 closest neighbors for each leaf based on path distance:

    >>> tdata = py.datasets.koblan25()
    >>> py.tl.tree_neighbors(tdata, n_neighbors=5, depth_key="time")
