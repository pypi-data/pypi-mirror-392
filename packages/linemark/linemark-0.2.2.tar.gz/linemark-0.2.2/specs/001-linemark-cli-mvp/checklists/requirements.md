## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Reviewer**: Automated validation

All checklist items have been verified. The specification is complete, technology-agnostic, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Key Strengths:
- 8 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) covering all major workflows
- 38 specific, testable functional requirements
- 12 measurable success criteria with concrete metrics
- No implementation details leaked into specification
- Comprehensive edge case coverage

The specification successfully transforms the detailed functional requirements into a user-focused, technology-agnostic feature description suitable for planning and implementation.
