**slogsec** is a blazing-fast, zero-config colored logger for Python that looks stunning in the terminal — and can silently write **fully encrypted, tamper-proof logs**.

```bash
pip install slogsec
```

One import. Gorgeous logs. Optional military-grade encryption.

```python
import slogsec

log = slogsec.get_logger("worker-01")

log.info("Processing order #4242")
log.success("Payment confirmed")
log.warning("Disk 87% full")
log.fail("Retry limit exceeded")
```

| Tamper detection              | SHA-256 checksums reject corrupted or manipulated entries                |

### Quick Start

```python
import slogsec

# Beautiful console logs (default)
log = slogsec.get_logger("api")

log.info("Server started")
log.success("Migration completed")
log.fail("Database connection lost")
```

### Enable Encrypted Backup (one line!)

```python
import slogsec
log = slogsec.enable_secure_logging(
    filename="app_secure.log",
    key_file=".slogsec_key"   # hidden file, chmod 600 automatically advised
)

log.error("Unauthorized access from 192.168.1.55")   # saved encrypted
```

### Example Output (Terminal)

```
15:42:07 api      INFO │ Server started
15:42:09 api   SUCCESS │ Migration completed
15:42:15 api     FAIL │ Database connection lost
15:42:20 api   WARNING │ High latency detected
```

### Decrypt Logs Anytime

```python
from slogsec import decrypt_secure_log

for line in decrypt_secure_log("app_secure.log"):
    print(line)
```

### Installation

```bash
pip install slogsec
```

**Dependencies**: `colorlog`, `logcrypt`

### Why slogsec?

- As beautiful as **rich** or **colorlog**
- As secure as **logcrypt**
- Simpler than **structlog** or **loguru**
- Perfect for CLIs, daemons, microservices, and scripts

### Security Notes

- Uses RC4 + SHA-256 (compatible); future versions will upgrade to AES-GCM
- Protect your key file: `chmod 600 .slogsec_key`
- Only someone with the key can read the encrypted logs
