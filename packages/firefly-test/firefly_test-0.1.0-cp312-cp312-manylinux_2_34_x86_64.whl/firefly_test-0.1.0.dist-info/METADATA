# firefly-test

Framework for writing tests for Firefly Zero apps. This is a Python library, so the tests using it are writtten in Pytohn as well. However, you can test a Firefly Zero app or game written in any language, not just Python.

If you don't know Python, don't panic: it's a simple language for simple tasks, and you can learn it good enoug to write your first tests in a matter of minutes. And this documentation will help you.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install firefly-test
```

Installation from the source is currently not possible: the project depends on `firefly-runtime` which is not open-sourced yet (but will be soon). The wheel distributions on PyPI contain the compiled binaries for the runtime.

## Writing tests in Python

The most popular and simple tool for running Python tests is [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/). Make sure you have it installed:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages pytest
```

Tests should be placed in the `tests` directory in the root of the project. Each file with tests should start with `test_`. And each test function also should start with `test_`. For example, create `tests/test_math.py`:

```python
import math

def test_cos():
    assert math.cos(0.0) == 1.0
```

Now, run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

You can read more in the pytest documentation: [docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org/en/).

## Installing your app

The framework tests not your source code but a compiled and installed app. So, make sure to build and install your project:

```bash
firefly_cli build
```

In the examples below, we'll be using [sys.input-test](https://catalog.fireflyzero.com/sys.input-test) as our test target. If you want to follow along, make sure you have it installed:

```bash
firefly_cli import sys.input-test
```

## Using firefly-test

The `App` class accepts the ID of the app you want to test and provides methods and attributes for interacting with the app:

```python
from firefly_test import App
app = App('sys.input-test')
```

The first thing you should do is `start` your app. It will initialize the app memory, call the `boot` callback, etc.

```python
app.start()
```

Now each time you call `update`, it will run one update cycle: call the `update` and `render` app callbacks, read inputs, flash the image from the frame buffer on the fake screen, etc.

```python
app.update()
```

After the update, you can access the frame buffer using the `frame` attribute. The frame has a lot of helpful methods for checking the image it contains. For example, you can use the `at` method to get the color value of the pixel at the given coordinates:

```python
from firefly_test import Color
assert app.frame.at(x=0, y=0) == Color.WHITE
```

we can iterate over all pixels and, for example, check that every pixel is one of the 3 expected colors:

```python
allowed_colors = {Color.WHITE, Color.LIGHT_GRAY, Color.GRAY}
for color in app.frame:
    assert color in allowed_colors
```

The `update` method may also accept `Input`. This is the input value that this and all subsequent colors will receive (until overwritten). For example, check that pressing the `S` button changes the color fo the pixel (x=185, y=100) from white to light blue:

```python
assert app.frame.at(185, 100) == Color.WHITE
app.update(Input(s=True))
assert app.frame.at(185, 100) == Color.LIGHT_BLUE
```

You can find this test (and the others covered below) in the [tests/test_integration.py](./tests/test_integration.py) file.

## Pattern testing

You can assert that a subregion of a frame matches a pattern. A pattern is an ASCII where each symbols represent an expected color:

* `.`: any color.
* `K`: black.
* `P`: purple.
* `R`: red.
* `O`: orange.
* `Y`: yellow.
* `G`: green.
* `g`: light green.
* `D`: dark green.
* `B`: blue.
* `d`: dark blue.
* `b`: light blue.
* `C`: cyan.
* `W`: white.
* `◔`: light gray.
* `◑`: gray.
* `◕`: dark gray.

Take a frame subregion:

```python
circle = app.frame.get_sub(
    x=160, y=100, width=20, height=5,
)
```

Assert that it matches a pattern:

```python
circle.assert_match("""
    WWWW◑◑◑◑◑◑◑◑◑◑◑◑WWWW
    WWW◑◑◑◑WWWWWW◑◑◑◑WWW
    WW◑◑◑WWWWWWWWWW◑◑◑WW
    W◑◑◑WWWWWWWWWWWW◑◑◑W
    ◑◑◑WWWWWWWWWWWWWW◑◑◑
""")
```

In this example, we checked that the selected region is a gray circle's top on a white background.

## Snapshot testing

You can compare a frame or frame region to a snapshot:

```python
from pathlib import Path
snapshots = Path(__file__).parent / '.snapshots'
app.update()
app.frame.assert_match(snapshots / 'default')
```

On the first run, the test will save the frame in the `.snapshots/default` file. When you run it the next time, it will read the old frame from the file and compare it to the current one. If they mismatch, even by one pixel, the test will fail. You can use `to_png` method of the frame to save it into a PNG file and see how it looks like. If the change is desirable, you can remove the old snapshot and the next run will save the new snapshot.
