## Installation

### Method 1: PyPI

`osier` is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/osier/). It may be installed with 
```bash
python -m pip install osier
``` 
or by cloning this repository and building from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arfc/osier.git  # requires ssh-keys
# or
git clone https://github.com/arfc/osier.git
cd osier
# for a basic installation
pip install .
# (Windows/Linux) to also install the documentation dependencies
pip install .[doc]
# (MacOS)
pip install .'[doc]'
```

### Method 2: Conda/Mamba Environment

Although `osier` is not yet available on `conda-forge`, you may have a more consistent experience by installing
`osier` via a `conda` environment.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:arfc/osier.git  # requires ssh-keys
mamba env create  # mamba and conda are interchangeable, here
mamba activate osier-env
```


## Documentation
The documentation for `osier` can be viewed [here](https://osier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
You can also build the docs locally with:

```bash
cd osier/docs
make html
cd build/html
# to serve the documentation
python -m http.server
```

```{note}
Users attempting a local install need to make sure that they have `pandoc` installed.
Please visit [`pandoc`'s documentation](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for 
instructions.
```

## Examples

The examples can be found in the `docs/source/examples/` directory. Alternatively, 
users can run the notebooks and experiment with `osier` through the Binder app.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samgdotson/osier/env-instructions?labpath=docs%2Fsource%2Fexamples)


## Tests
`osier`'s tests can be run by executing `pytest` in the top-level directory 
of `osier`.

```{note}
The test package assumes the user has `coin-or-cbc` installed as the default solver. For Windows machines,
this may require some additional steps to install the solver. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58868054/how-to-install-coincbc-using-conda-in-windows) is a helpful place to start.
```


## Contributing

Contributions to `osier` are welcome. For details on how to make bug reports, pull requests, and other information, check the [contributing page](docs/source/contrib.md).


## Credits
Some of the documentation infrastructure was inspired by and borrowed from the [`watts` documentation](https://watts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
