        -&nbsp;This update is being published for the below three reasons:</p>\\n\\n<p>1.
        To answer two bidder questions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q1: (1) Re: Volume III Small Business
        Participation Plan &ndash; If we commit to making a genuine good faith effort
        to achieve all of the subcontracting commitments listed in our Plan, but choose
        to label them as &ldquo;non-enforceable,&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;enforceable,&rdquo;
        will this negatively impact how our proposal is evaluated? (2) If we label
        some or all of the commitments as enforceable, but fail to achieve the set
        targets, what will the consequences be? &nbsp;Please clarify.<br />\\nA1:
        (1) A &ldquo;non-enforceable&rdquo; subcontracting commitment will not negatively
        impact how a proposal is evaluated. &nbsp;However, an &ldquo;enforceable&rdquo;
        subcontracting commitment will positively impact how a proposal is evaluated.
        &nbsp;As noted in subparagraph 3 of the Small Business Participation evaluation
        provision (see Attachment 7, p. 8), the Small Business Participation Plan
        will be evaluated in terms of the offeror&rsquo;s proposed subcontracting
        participation, the extent of commitment to use the subcontractor(s) (enforceable
        vs. non-enforceable commitments), and the offeror&rsquo;s established or planned
        procedures for small business outreach and utilization. &nbsp; Thus, it would
        be reasonable to expect that the Contracting Officer would rate proposals
        showing a greater commitment to enforceable subcontracting participation more
        highly than similar commitments or goals that were not considered enforceable.
        &nbsp;(2) &ldquo;Enforceable&rdquo; subcontracting commitments will become
        part of the terms and conditions of the contract; therefore, a breach of the
        terms of the contract may impact administration of the contract, including
        the documentation of performance in CPARS and could play a role in decisions
        regarding termination or option exercise. &nbsp;Additionally, firms that are
        not small businesses and are required to file a subcontracting plan should
        note the requirement to annually document how they performed compared to their
        plan via the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS). &nbsp;As noted
        in the Small Business Subcontracting Plan Submittal requirements (Attachment
        7, p. 5) &nbsp;the Government will document performance accordingly.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q2:
        Re: Volume III Small Business Participation Plan &ndash; Do subcontractors
        have to be registered in Sam.Gov or be certified by any particular certifying
        agency? Please clarify the eligibility requirements, if any.<br />\\nA2: Short
        answer, no, they do not have to be registered. &nbsp;If you have the CAGE
        of a subcontractor, please identify it. &nbsp;However, if the subcontractor
        is not registered in SAM, the procedures from FAR 52.219-8(e)(1) may be used,
        which say &quot;The Contractor may accept a subcontractor&#39;s written representations
        of its size and socioeconomic status as a small business, small disadvantaged
        business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small
        business, or a women-owned small business if the subcontractor represents
        that the size and socioeconomic status representations with its offer are
        current, accurate, and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontract.&quot;</p>\\n\\n<p><br

        -&nbsp;This update is being published for the below three reasons:</p>\\n\\n<p>1.
        To answer six bidder questions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q1: The 12 month order history
        shows very large volumes of supplies being purchased which is not represented
        in the new volumes. &nbsp;Are supplies now being purchased under a separate
        contract and this will be used as a backup?<br />\\nA1: No. This is the only
        contract being used for supplies.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q2: There was a very large volume
        of alkaline batteries shipped last year, well above the new 30-month anticipated
        volume. &nbsp;Was there an event that caused the higher volume?<br />\\nA:
        No event is known. &nbsp;A 30-month ordering history (not 12-month) from the
        current contract was used for the estimated quantities on this new contract.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q3:
        Volume I &ndash; In addition to the Minimum Content requested in Attachment
        7, Page 2 (items a-h), do you also want information on our approach to performing
        the project work?&nbsp;<br />\\nA3: No additional information is wanted. &nbsp;Only
        the information requested will be evaluated. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p>Q4: Volume
        III &ndash; Small Business Participation Plan &ndash; Is the 5% participation
        goal for Small Disadvantaged Businesses a required subcontracting obligation
        or an aspirational target the awarded contractor is expected to make a good
        faith effort to achieve?<br />\\nA4: &nbsp;It is a goal; it is not a required
        subcontracting obligation. &nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p>Q5: Do you want us to provide
        fully burdened unit rates for all line items to include overhead, profit margin,
        fuel and insurance costs, etc. (everything EXCEPT taxes)?&nbsp;<br />\\nA5:
        Yes, we need the fully burdened price. &nbsp;This will be a firm-fixed-priced
        contract, so the only prices paid to the contractor will be the prices on
        the price schedule.</p>\\n\\n<p>Q6: Can you also provide the solicitation/contract
        number that this service was provided under?<br />\\nA6: SP450020R0003 and
        SP450020D0011.</p>\\n\\n<p><br />\\n2. To announce the intent to upload another
        version of the price schedule.&nbsp; Sadly, a few more typos need to be corrrected.&nbsp;

        more answers to questions received will be posted with that update.</p>\\n\\n<p><br
        />\\n3. To extend the solicitation deadline to 1500EST on Friday, 31JAN2025.
        &nbsp;This does not extend the cut-off date for the receipt of offeror questions,
        which was fourteen days prior to the original proposal due date, which was
        06JAN2025. &nbsp;Any new questions received may not receive an answer.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<p>***</p>\\n\\n<p>03JAN2025

        been removed in V3.&nbsp; Additionally, CLIN 1901SA has been removed and replaced
