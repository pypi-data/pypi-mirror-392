# Codexify

Codexify is a lightweight Python library for transforming text into a custom encoded form.  
It applies a simple character-shifting algorithm to letters and digits while keeping all other symbols unchanged.

This library is intended for simple text encoding, experiments, or as a foundation for custom cipher logic.
