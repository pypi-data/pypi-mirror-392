# Polars ST

Polars ST provides spatial operations on [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) DataFrames, Series, and Expressions. Just like [Shapely](https://github.com/shapely/shapely/) and [GeoPandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas), it make use of the [GEOS](https://github.com/libgeos/geos) library, meaning that its API is mostly identical to theirs.

```pycon
>>> import polars_st as st
>>> gdf = st.GeoDataFrame({
...     "category": ["A", "A", "B"],
...     "geometry": [
...         "POLYGON((0 0, 0 4, 4 2, 0 0))",
...         "POLYGON((4 0, 4 4, 0 2, 4 0))",
...         "POLYGON((0 0, 2 2, 2 0, 0 0))",
...     ]
... })
>>> gdf = gdf.group_by("category").agg(st.intersection_all()).with_columns(area=st.area())
>>> gdf.with_columns(st.to_wkt())
shape: (2, 3)

## Installation

Polars ST is published on PyPI so you can install it with your preferred package manager.

```sh
pip install polars-st
```

## How it works

Geometries are stored as EWKB in regular Polars Binary columns. EWKB is a extension to the WKB standard popularized by PostGIS, that also stores information about the CRS of each geometry as an integer code called SRID.

For every spatial operations, the WKB will be parsed into a Geometry object so the operation can be done. If the operation result is a geometry, it will then be serialized back to WKB. Because of that round-trip, some operations might turn out to be slower than GeoPandas. In most cases however, the performance penalty will be marginal and you will fully benefit from the parallelization capabilities of Polars.


## About GeoPolars

[GeoPolars](https://github.com/geopolars/geopolars) is an very promising tool for manipulating geographic data in Polars based on the [GeoArrow](https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow) specification. It however seems to be quite a long way from being ready and feature-complete, mostly due to Polars lack of support for [Arrow Extension Types](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/9112) and [subclassing of core datatypes](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/2846#issuecomment-1711799869).

`polars-st` stores geometry as EWKB in regular Binary columns and delegates core functionality to GEOS, which allows it to be ready now, with full support for Z / M coordinates, curved geometry types (CircularString, CurvePolygon, ...) and Series with mixed geometry type and SRIDs.

## About Polars

This project is not affiliated with Polars. The design language was deliberately made very close to that of Polars to highlight the fact that this is an exclusive extension to Polars, and as a tribute to the effectiveness of the original design.


## About GEOS

In order to save myself (and yourself) from the burden of GEOS version-specific features and bugs, `polars-st` statically link to GEOS `main`. This means that all documented features are guaranteed to be available. This also means that this project is LGPL licensed, the same way GEOS is.
