    :param bool exclude: Exclude these criteria from the parent criteria.
    :param bool required: Only relevant for subcriteria. If set to true\, objects matching this subcriteria are required \(AND\-ed together with parent criteria\).
    :param list eventIdentifier: Search for events specified by full ID \(type\/timestamp\/customerID\/eventID\).
    :param list locationID: Search for events having these locations.
    :param list severity: Search events with specified severity. Can\'t be used together with minSeverity\/maxSeverity.
    :param list customer: Search for events by customer \(id or shortname\).
    :param list alarmID: Search for events having an attack identifier \(signature\) mapped to any of these alarms.
    :param list attackCategoryID: Search for events having an attack identifier \(signature\) mapped to any of these categories.
    :param list sourceGeoCountry: Search for events where source IP is registered in any of these countries.
    :param list destinationGeoCountry: Search for events where destination IP is registered in any of these countries.
    :param list geoCountry: Search for events where source or destination IP is registered in any of these countries.
    :param list domain: Search for events having one of these domains. The domains are not validated
    :param dict properties: Search for events having these properties \(logical AND\).
    :param bool productionCustomers: If set\, apply a customer filter for customers marked as \'not in production\'. If true\, EXCLUDE customers \'not in production\'. If false\, REQUIRE customers \'not in production\'. Default is unset \(no filter on production customers\).
    :param list sensorID: List of sensor IDs that must have a match in the retrieved event.
    :param list subCriteria: Subcriterias used to refine the search by including or excluding events.
    :param list timeFieldStrategy: Defines which timestamps will be included in the search\, will default to timestamp.
    :param list signature:
    :param str endTimestamp: Restrict search to data before this time \(epoch millis\) according to selected TimeFieldStrategies.

WARN\: The count of response would not be reliable\, as the filtering is applied in\-memory of application server\, but the count was done by search engine.
    :param str multivaluePropertySeparator: Separator that is going to be used when formatting the multi\-value properties of the found events.
