## 📦 Build & Release  (Maintainers Only)

### Local Build
One-liner: sets version, builds executables & wheels, uploads
<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```powershell
scripts\build_deploy_local.bat 0.1.0
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>macOS / Linux</summary>

```bash
./scripts/build_deploy_local.sh 0.1.0
```

</details>


### CI / GitHub Actions Release

1. **Tag & push**

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Release**
   Creating a release from the tag triggers the workflow that builds and uploads the package (with the version derived from the tag).

### Versioning

* Versions are derived by **setuptools-scm** from git tags
* No need to modify `__version__` strings
