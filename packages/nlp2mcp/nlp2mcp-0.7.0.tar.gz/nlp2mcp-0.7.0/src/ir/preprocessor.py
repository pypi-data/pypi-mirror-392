"""GAMS file preprocessing for $include directives.

This module handles GAMS $include directives by performing simple textual
substitution before parsing. The preprocessor:
- Recursively expands all $include directives
- Resolves paths relative to the containing file
- Detects circular includes and reports the full cycle chain
- Maintains an include stack for error reporting
- Supports both quoted and unquoted file paths

Based on KNOWN_UNKNOWNS.md findings:
- Unknown 1.1: GAMS uses simple string substitution without macro expansion
- Unknown 1.4: Arbitrary nesting allowed, use depth limit (default 100)
- Unknown 1.5: Paths resolved relative to containing file, not CWD
