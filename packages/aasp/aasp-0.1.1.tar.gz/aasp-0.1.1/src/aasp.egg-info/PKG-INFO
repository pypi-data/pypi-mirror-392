# MLM25: MaveDB Amino Acid Substitution Prediction
## Summary
Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variants is a cornerstone of modern genomics. Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs) provide high-throughput measurements of how thousands of variants impact gene function, and MaveDB is a growing repository of these datasets, but it is still expensive and time-consuming to experimentally test every variant. In this challenge, your task is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the functional outcomes of amino acid substitutions.
