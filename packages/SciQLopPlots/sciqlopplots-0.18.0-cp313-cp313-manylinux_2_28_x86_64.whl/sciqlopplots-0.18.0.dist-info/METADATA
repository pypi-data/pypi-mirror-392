# SciQLopPlots - A High-Performance Plotting Library for Scientific Data


SciQLopPlots is a powerful and efficient plotting library designed for the [SciQLop](https://github.com/SciQLop/SciQLop) scientific data analysis platform. It provides interactive visualization capabilities optimized for handling large-scale scientific datasets with seamless integration into SciQLop's ecosystem.


## Key Features

- **High-Performance Rendering**: Optimized for smooth interaction with large non uniform 1D, 2D datasets.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Pan, zoom, and inspect data points in real time.
- **Multiple Plot Types**: Supports time series, spectrograms, parametric curves.
- **Customizable Styling**: Adjust colors, labels, axes, and plot layouts programmatically or via GUI.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
