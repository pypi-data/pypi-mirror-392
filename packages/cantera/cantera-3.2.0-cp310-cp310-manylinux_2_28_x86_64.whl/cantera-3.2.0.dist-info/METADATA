What is Cantera?
================

Cantera is an open-source collection of object-oriented software tools for
problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and transport processes.
Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

Cantera can be used from a number of different programming languages. Numerous examples
are available on the Cantera website:

* `Python <https://cantera.org/stable/examples/python/index.html>`_
* `Matlab <https://cantera.org/stable/examples/matlab/index.html>`_
* `C++ <https://cantera.org/stable/examples/cxx/index.html>`_
* `C <https://cantera.org/stable/examples/clib/index.html>`_
* `Fortran 90 <https://cantera.org/stable/examples/fortran/index.html>`_
