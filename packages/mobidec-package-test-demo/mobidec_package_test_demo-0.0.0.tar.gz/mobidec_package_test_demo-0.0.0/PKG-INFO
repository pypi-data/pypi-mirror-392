## Description

This "Python Package" template is a complete template designed to create a Python package according to IFPEN's development standards, deployable internally within IFPEN or on the Cloud. This template provides developers with a Python project architecture in which they can contribute, document, and make it available to all IFPEN developers.

This package includes:
- A unit test structure based on the [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) library
- Automatic documentation generation based on the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) library
- A CI/CD pipeline for deploying the Python package to a Python server

This file is configured to use Python 3.12 and runs commands for the linter `ruff` as well as for tests with `pytest`. The specified commands check code style, format files according to defined standards, and run unit tests to ensure the code works as expected. This file is also used to facilitate version management tasks with `bump-my-version`.
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires **Python 3.12**. Python 3.12 introduces many new features and improvements that are essential for the proper functioning of this project. Ensure that Python is correctly installed on your system by running `python --version`.

### About the `pyproject.toml` File

The `pyproject.toml` file is a central configuration file for the Python project. It contains TOML tables specifying the basic metadata of the project, the dependencies needed to build your project, and specific configurations for the tools used.
The `[project]` table is used to specify the basic metadata of your project, such as dependencies, your name, etc. The `[tool]` table contains sub-tables specific to each tool, such as `[tool.setuptools]` or `[tool.ruff]`. For more information on configuring your `pyproject.toml`, refer to the [Python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/).

### Installing Dependencies

The `pyproject.toml` file is used to manage the dependencies of this project. To install these dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command `pip install .` to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

This process ensures that all required dependencies are correctly installed in your environment, allowing you to work on the project with all necessary resources.

To add or modify project dependencies, you must list them in your `pyproject.toml` file under the `dependencies` section.

```bash
dependencies = [
    "pytest == 8.0.1",
    # add necessary dependencies
]
```

### Developing the Package

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is an essential guide for developing this Python package. It describes the steps to set up the development environment, the coding conventions to follow, and how to submit changes. 
Once your changes are ready, push your contribution to the desired branch to trigger the integration pipeline, which will create the Python package and deploy it to the Python server.
For more details on contributing and best practices, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Using the Python Package

### Installation

If you are using the provided `pip.conf`, you can simply run:

```bash
pip install mobidec_package_test_demo
```

Otherwise, you can specify the package index depending on whether you are in an internal (on-premise) or external (cloud) environment.

```bash
# On-premise
pip install mobidec_package_test_demo --extra-index-url https://nexus.ifpen.fr/repository/fast-it/simple

# On Cloud
pip install mobidec_package_test_demo --extra-index-url https://nexus.fastit.dev/repository/fast-it/simple
```

Alternatively, you can set the package index URL as an environment variable:

```bash
# On-premise
export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://nexus.fastit.dev/repository/fast-it/simple

# On Cloud
export PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://nexus.ifpen.fr/repository/fast-it/simple
```

### Example Usage of the Python Package in Your Code

After installation, you can import and use your package and its functions in your Python code:

```python
from package import hello_world

hello_world()
```

To use sub-modules defined in the package:

```python
from package.divider import divide

a = 4.0
b = 2.0

c = divide(4., 2.)
```

These instructions will allow you to access the package and utilize its features effectively and in line with your development configuration.
