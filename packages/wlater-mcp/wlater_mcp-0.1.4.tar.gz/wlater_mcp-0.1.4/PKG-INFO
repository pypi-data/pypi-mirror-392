# wlater MCP Server

Connect your AI assistant to Google Keep. Search, read, and manage your notes and lists through natural conversation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install wlater-mcp
```

## Setup

### Quick Setup (Automated)

For automated authentication with Selenium:

```bash
pip install selenium
wlater-setup token
```

A browser window will open—just log in to your Google account and the token will be extracted automatically.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup or automated doesn't work:

```bash
wlater-setup
```

You'll need your master token. Get it from:
- [gpsoauth Guide](https://github.com/rukins/gpsoauth-java/blob/b74ebca999d0f5bd38a2eafe3c0d50be552f6385/README.md#receiving-an-authentication-token)
- [gkeepapi Documentation](https://gkeepapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#authenticating)

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client's config file (e.g., `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wlater": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "wlater_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart your AI assistant and you're ready!

- "Create a note called 'Meeting Notes'"
- "Add 'call dentist' to my todo list"
- "Find notes labeled 'work'"
- "Make my important note red and pin it"
