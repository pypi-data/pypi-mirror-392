# Imodulator

Imodulator is aimed to be an all in one photonic electro-optic modulator design tool with complete modularity providing consistent optical mode solving, charge transport simulations, RF mode solving and transmission line analysis for arbitrary materials and cross sections.

## Instalation

To get started with this package you must first clone the repository somewhere on your laptop. For that run:

```console
cd path\to\your\directory
```

```console
git clone https://gitlab.tue.nl/tue-phi/photonmod.git
```

Now we will install the package **with the local files**. This means that instead of the package being installed in your python environment in the `site-packages` folder, python will fetch the files in the current directory. This is useful for development:

```console
pip install -e .
```

Now you can try to create a `.py` file and run `import photonmod`. If it gives no errors, you're done!
