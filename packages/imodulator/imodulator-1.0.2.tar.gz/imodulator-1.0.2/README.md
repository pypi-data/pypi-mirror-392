# Welcome to the Imodulator's repository

**Imodulator** is an all-in-one tool for the simulation of electro-optic phase modulators.  
Simply define your geometry and materials, and then send the information to the various solvers available — including optical mode solver, RF mode solver with small-signal analysis, charge transport simulations, and electro-optic interaction simulations.

## Current Limitations

For the moment, the full functionality of the **Imodulator** package is limited to InGaAsP alloys lattice-matched to InP. However, when we consider the different parts of the simulator, we have various limitations that may or may not be relevant.

- **`OpticalSimulatorFEMWELL`**:  
  There is virtually no limitation here. As long as you provide a refractive index for each polygon, you're good to go.

- **`OpticalSimulatorMODE`**:  
  There is virtually no limitation here. As long as you provide a refractive index for each polygon, you're good to go.

- **`RFSimulatorFEMWELL`**:  
  There is also no limitation in this solver. You need only to input the material properties and it will work.

- **`ChargeSimulatorSolcore`**:  
  [`Solcore`](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore5) has been developed with solar cells in mind, and we have found that the internal library of material parameters was limiting for the purpose of this package.  
  Therefore, we have made a connection between `Solcore` and `openbandparams` so that we can use arbitrary III–V alloys (excluding strain effects) in solving the Poisson–drift–diffusion equations.  
  The limitation here is that we must work with III–V alloys only.  
  Furthermore, the mobility values are calculated through `Solcore` via [mobility_solcore](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore5/blob/develop/solcore/material_data/mobility.py), and we are therefore limited to:

  - InGaAs  
  - InGaP  
  - AlGaAs  
  - InAlAs  
  - InGaAsP  

- **`ChargeSimulatorNN`**:  
  There isn’t really a limitation here. We only need to provide materials supported by [NextNano](https://www.nextnano.com/error_pages/404.php).

- **`ElectroOpticalModels`**:  
  We have only included a model compatible with electro-optical effects that take place in InGaAsP alloys lattice-matched to InP. However, the software has been written to allow for any model, as long as we provide a  
  
  ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\Delta\bar{\epsilon}(V,E_c,E_v,E_{fp},E_{fv},\mu_n,\mu_p,\vec{E},N,P))  
  
  function.

## Where You Can Contribute

- Generalization of [openbandparams](https://github.com/duarte-jfs/openbandparams) to include other semiconductor compounds such as Si and SiGe.  
- Generalization of [mobility_solcore](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore5/blob/develop/solcore/material_data/mobility.py) to include other mobility models explored in [Sotoodeh *et al.*, 2000](https://doi.org/10.1109/16.826799).  
  Alternatively, one could explore the inclusion of those models directly in `openbandparams`.
- Include more electro-optic models.  
- Include surface impedance boundary conditions in the RF mode solver. 
- Include a 2D PDD solver based on [sesame](https://sesame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) integrated with `openbandparams`
- Improve the documentation (**help wanted!**).

If you have any questions please reach out to the **Discussions** tab and we can brainstorm some ideas.
