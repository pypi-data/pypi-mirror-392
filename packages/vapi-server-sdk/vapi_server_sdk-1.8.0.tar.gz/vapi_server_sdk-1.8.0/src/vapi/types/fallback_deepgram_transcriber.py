    Here are the most important bits:
    - Defaults to 10. This is recommended for most use cases to optimize for latency.
    - 10 can cause some missing transcriptions since because of the shorter context. This mostly happens for one-word utterances. For those uses cases, it's recommended to try 300. It will add a bit of latency but the quality and reliability of the experience will be better.
    - If neither 10 nor 300 work, contact support@vapi.ai and we'll find another solution.
