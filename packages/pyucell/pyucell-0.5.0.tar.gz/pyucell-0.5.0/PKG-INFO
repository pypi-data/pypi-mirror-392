In single-cell RNA-seq analysis, gene signature (or “module”) scoring constitutes a simple yet powerful approach to evaluate the strength of biological signals – typically associated to a specific cell type or biological process – in a transcriptome.

UCell is a computational method for evaluating gene signatures in single-cell datasets. UCell signature scores, based on the Mann-Whitney U statistic, are robust to dataset size and heterogeneity, and their calculation demands less computing time and memory than other available methods, enabling the processing of large datasets in a few minutes even on machines with limited computing power.

[pyUCell](https://github.com/carmonalab/pyucell) is a python implementation for the UCell algorithm, also available for the R programming language ([Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/UCell/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/carmonalab/UCell))

### Getting started

Please see installation instructions below, and refer to the [documentation][].

### Installation

Install the latest release of `pyUCell` from [PyPI][]:

```bash
pip install pyucell
```


or, for the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/carmonalab/pyucell.git@master
```


### Test the installation
```python
import pyucell as uc
import scanpy as sc

adata = sc.datasets.pbmc3k()

signatures = {
    'T_cell': ['CD3D', 'CD3E', 'CD2'],
    'B_cell': ['MS4A1', 'CD79A', 'CD79B']
}

uc.compute_ucell_scores(adata, signatures=signatures)
```

### Tutorials and how-to

Have a look at the [documentation][] section; you may start from a [basic tutorial][] or explore [some important pyUCell parameters][]
