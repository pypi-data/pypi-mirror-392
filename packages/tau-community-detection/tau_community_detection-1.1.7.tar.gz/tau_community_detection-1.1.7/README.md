`tau-community-detection` implements TAU, an evolutionary community detection algorithm
that couples genetic search with Leiden refinements. It is designed for scalable graph
clustering with configurable hyper-parameters and multiprocessing support.

---

## Highlights

- **Evolutionary search**: Maintains a population of candidate partitions and applies
  crossover/mutation tailored for graph clustering.
- **Leiden optimisation**: Refines every candidate with Leiden to ensure modularity gains.
- **Multiprocessing aware**: Utilises worker pools for population optimisation.
- **Deterministic options**: Accepts a user-specified random seed for reproducibility.
- **Simple API**: Access everything through the `TauClustering` class.

## Installation

The project targets Python 3.10 or newer (required for slot-based dataclasses).

```bash
pip install tau-community-detection
```

To work from a clone, install the package in editable mode inside a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HillelCharbit/community_TAU.git
cd community_TAU
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quick Start (Python API)

```python
from tau_community_detection import TauClustering
import networkx as nx

graph = nx.read_adjlist("path/to/graph.adjlist")

clustering = TauClustering(
    graph,
    population_size=80,
    max_generations=250,
)
membership, modularity_history = clustering.run()

print("community for node 0:", membership[0])
print("best modularity:", modularity_history[-1])
```

Need detailed per-generation metrics? Call `run(track_stats=True)` to receive
`(membership, modularity_history, generation_stats)` where `generation_stats`
is a list of dictionaries containing time and fitness diagnostics.
```

### Graph input

`TauClustering` accepts either an `igraph.Graph` or a `networkx.Graph` instance. Nodes are
internally remapped to contiguous integers to maximise igraph performance. If your data
resides on disk, load it into memory first (for example with `nx.read_adjlist`) before
initializing `TauClustering`.

---

## Example Script

The repository ships with a runnable example that uses the bundled
`src/tau_community_detection/examples/example.graph` file. To execute it from the project
root:

```bash
python3 src/tau_community_detection/run_clustering.py
```

The script prints the detected membership vector and the modularity score history.

> Note: multiprocessing may be restricted inside some sandboxed environments. Run the
> example on a local machine for best results.

## Configuration

All algorithm hyper-parameters live on the `TauConfig` dataclass. You can pass a custom
configuration instance to `TauClustering` or adjust attributes on the default one. Key
fields include:

- `population_size`: number of partitions maintained per generation.
- `max_generations`: upper bound on evolutionary iterations.
- `elite_fraction` / `immigrant_fraction`: govern selection pressure.
- `stopping_generations` / `stopping_jaccard`: convergence checks based on membership
  stability.
- `random_seed`: makes runs reproducible across processes.

See `src/tau_community_detection/config.py` for the complete list.

---

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
make lint
make test
```

To build local distributions:

```bash
make build
```

### Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions run lint, tests, and package builds on pushes and pull requests.
- Set the `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret to upload coverage reports.

### Publishing

1. Bump the version in `setup.cfg`/`pyproject.toml` and commit.
2. Tag the release with `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags`.
3. Run the **Publish Package** workflow (defaults to TestPyPI). For PyPI, supply the `pypi`
   input and ensure `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is set. Use `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN` for dry runs.
