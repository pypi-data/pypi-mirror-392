[Read more about it here](/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast).\n\nThis tutorial will show how to make chatbot UIs from scratch with Gradio's low-level Blocks API. This will give you full control over your Chatbot UI. You'll start by first creating a a simple chatbot to display text, a second one to stream text responses, and finally a chatbot that can handle media files as well. The chatbot interface that we create will look something like this:\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_streaming'></gradio-app>\n\n**Prerequisite**: We'll be using the `gradio.Blocks` class to build our Chatbot demo.\nYou can [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/blocks-and-event-listeners) if you are not already familiar with it. Also please make sure you are using the **latest version** version of Gradio: `pip install --upgrade gradio`.\n\n## A Simple Chatbot Demo\n\nLet's start with recreating the simple demo above. As you may have noticed, our bot simply randomly responds \"How are you?\", \"Today is a great day\", or \"I'm very hungry\" to any input. Here's the code to create this with Gradio:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.ClearButton([msg, chatbot])\n\n    def respond(message, chat_history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"Today is a great day\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        chat_history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": message})\n        chat_history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": bot_message})\n        time.sleep(2)\n        return \"\", chat_history\n\n    msg.submit(respond, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nThere are three Gradio components here:\n\n- A `Chatbot`, whose value stores the entire history of the conversation, as a list of response pairs between the user and bot.\n- A `Textbox` where the user can type their message, and then hit enter/submit to trigger the chatbot response\n- A `ClearButton` button to clear the Textbox and entire Chatbot history\n\nWe have a single function, `respond()`, which takes in the entire history of the chatbot, appends a random message, waits 1 second, and then returns the updated chat history. The `respond()` function also clears the textbox when it returns.\n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `respond()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_simple'></gradio-app>\n            <div class='tip'>\n                <span class=\"inline-flex\" style=\"align-items: baseline\">\n                    <svg class=\"self-center w-5 h-5 mx-1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"800px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n                        <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.25 18.7089C9.25 18.2894 9.58579 17.9494 10 17.9494H14C14.4142 17.9494 14.75 18.2894 14.75 18.7089C14.75 19.1283 14.4142 19.4684 14 19.4684H10C9.58579 19.4684 9.25 19.1283 9.25 18.7089ZM9.91667 21.2405C9.91667 20.821 10.2525 20.481 10.6667 20.481H13.3333C13.7475 20.481 14.0833 20.821 14.0833 21.2405C14.0833 21.66 13.7475 22 13.3333 22H10.6667C10.2525 22 9.91667 21.66 9.91667 21.2405Z\"/>\n                        <path d=\"M7.41058 13.8283L8.51463 14.8807C8.82437 15.1759 9 15.5875 9 16.0182C9 16.6653 9.518 17.1899 10.157 17.1899H13.843C14.482 17.1899 15 16.6653 15 16.0182C15 15.5875 15.1756 15.1759 15.4854 14.8807L16.5894 13.8283C18.1306 12.3481 18.9912 10.4034 18.9999 8.3817L19 8.29678C19 4.84243 15.866 2 12 2C8.13401 2 5 4.84243 5 8.29678L5.00007 8.3817C5.00875 10.4034 5.86939 12.3481 7.41058 13.8283Z\"/>\n                    </svg>\n                <span><strong>Tip:</strong></span>\n                </span>\n                <p>For better type hinting and auto-completion in your IDE, you can use the <code>gr.ChatMessage</code> dataclass:</p>\n            </div>\n                \n\n```python\nfrom gradio import ChatMessage\n\ndef chat_function(message, history):\n    history.append(ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=message))\n    history.append(ChatMessage(role=\"assistant\", content=\"Hello, how can I help you?\"))\n    return history\n```\n\n## Add Streaming to your Chatbot\n\nThere are several ways we can improve the user experience of the chatbot above. First, we can stream responses so the user doesn't have to wait as long for a message to be generated. Second, we can have the user message appear immediately in the chat history, while the chatbot's response is being generated. Here's the code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n\n    def user(user_message, history: list):\n        return \"\", history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_message}]\n\n    def bot(history: list):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"})\n        for character in bot_message:\n            history[-1]['content'] += character\n            time.sleep(0.05)\n            yield history\n\n    msg.submit(user, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot], queue=False).then(\n        bot, chatbot, chatbot\n    )\n    clear.click(lambda: None, None, chatbot, queue=False)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nYou'll notice that when a user submits their message, we now _chain_ two event events with `.then()`:\n\n1. The first method `user()` updates the chatbot with the user message and clears the input field. Because we want this to happen instantly, we set `queue=False`, which would skip any queue had it been enabled. The chatbot's history is appended with `{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_message}`.\n\n2. The second method, `bot()` updates the chatbot history with the bot's response. Finally, we construct the message character by character and `yield` the intermediate outputs as they are being constructed. Gradio automatically turns any function with the `yield` keyword [into a streaming output interface](/guides/key-features/#iterative-outputs).\n\n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `bot()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.\n\n\n## Adding Markdown, Images, Audio, or Videos\n\nThe `gr.Chatbot` component supports a subset of markdown including bold, italics, and code. For example, we could write a function that responds to a user's message, with a bold **That's cool!**, like this:\n\n```py\ndef bot(history):\n    response = {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"**That's cool!**\"}\n    history.append(response)\n    return history\n```\n\nIn addition, it can handle media files, such as images, audio, and video. You can use the `MultimodalTextbox` component to easily upload all types of media files to your chatbot. You can customize the `MultimodalTextbox` further by passing in the `sources` parameter, which is a list of sources to enable. To pass in a media file, we must pass in the file a dictionary with a `path` key pointing to a local file and an `alt_text` key. The `alt_text` is optional, so you can also just pass in a tuple with a single element `{\"path\": \"filepath\"}`, like this:\n\n```python\ndef add_message(history, message):\n    for x in message[\"files\"]:\n        history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": {\"path\": x}})\n    if message[\"text\"] is not None:\n        history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": message[\"text\"]})\n    return history, gr.MultimodalTextbox(value=None, interactive=False, file_types=[\"image\"], sources=[\"upload\", \"microphone\"])\n```\n\nPutting this together, we can create a _multimodal_ chatbot with a multimodal textbox for a user to submit text and media files. The rest of the code looks pretty much the same as before:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\n# Chatbot demo with multimodal input (text, markdown, LaTeX, code blocks, image, audio, & video). Plus shows support for streaming text.\n\n\ndef print_like_dislike(x: gr.LikeData):\n    print(x.index, x.value, x.liked)\n\n\ndef add_message(history, message):\n    user_msg = {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": []}\n    for x in message[\"files\"]:\n        user_msg[\"content\"].append({\"path\": x})\n    if message[\"text\"] is not None:\n       user_msg[\"content\"].append(message[\"text\"])\n    history.append(user_msg)\n    return history, gr.MultimodalTextbox(value=None, interactive=False)\n\n\ndef bot(history: list):\n    response = \"**That's cool!**\"\n    history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"\"})\n    for character in response:\n        history[-1][\"content\"] += character\n        time.sleep(0.05)\n        yield history\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot(elem_id=\"chatbot\", like_user_message=True)\n\n    chat_input = gr.MultimodalTextbox(\n        interactive=True,\n        file_count=\"multiple\",\n        placeholder=\"Enter message or upload file...\",\n        show_label=False,\n        sources=[\"microphone\", \"upload\"],\n    )\n\n    chat_msg = chat_input.submit(\n        add_message, [chatbot, chat_input], [chatbot, chat_input]\n    )\n    bot_msg = chat_msg.then(bot, chatbot, chatbot, api_name=\"bot_response\")\n    bot_msg.then(lambda: gr.MultimodalTextbox(interactive=True), None, [chat_input])\n\n    chatbot.like(print_like_dislike, None, None)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_multimodal'></gradio-app>\n\nAnd you're done!
