ASR algorithms run on practically every smartphone, and are becoming increasingly embedded in professional workflows, such as digital assistants for nurses and doctors. Because ASR algorithms are designed to be used directly by customers and end users, it is important to validate that they are behaving as expected when confronted with a wide variety of speech patterns (different accents, pitches, and background audio conditions).\n\nUsing `gradio`, you can easily build a demo of your ASR model and share that with a testing team, or test it yourself by speaking through the microphone on your device.\n\nThis tutorial will show how to take a pretrained speech-to-text model and deploy it with a Gradio interface. We will start with a **_full-context_** model, in which the user speaks the entire audio before the prediction runs. Then we will adapt the demo to make it **_streaming_**, meaning that the audio model will convert speech as you speak. \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). You will also need a pretrained speech recognition model. In this tutorial, we will build demos from 2 ASR libraries:\n\n- Transformers (for this, `pip install torch transformers torchaudio`)\n\nMake sure you have at least one of these installed so that you can follow along the tutorial. You will also need `ffmpeg` [installed on your system](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), if you do not already have it, to process files from the microphone.\n\nHere's how to build a real time speech recognition (ASR) app:\n\n1. [Set up the Transformers ASR Model](#1-set-up-the-transformers-asr-model)\n2. [Create a Full-Context ASR Demo with Transformers](#2-create-a-full-context-asr-demo-with-transformers)\n3. [Create a Streaming ASR Demo with Transformers](#3-create-a-streaming-asr-demo-with-transformers)\n\n## 1. Set up the Transformers ASR Model\n\nFirst, you will need to have an ASR model that you have either trained yourself or you will need to download a pretrained model. In this tutorial, we will start by using a pretrained ASR model from the model, `whisper`.\n\nHere is the code to load `whisper` from Hugging Face `transformers`.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\np = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", model=\"openai/whisper-base.en\")\n```\n\nThat's it!\n\n## 2. Create a Full-Context ASR Demo with Transformers\n\nWe will start by creating a _full-context_ ASR demo, in which the user speaks the full audio before using the ASR model to run inference. This is very easy with Gradio -- we simply create a function around the `pipeline` object above.\n\nWe will use `gradio`'s built in `Audio` component, configured to take input from the user's microphone and return a filepath for the recorded audio. The output component will be a plain `Textbox`.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport numpy as np\n\ntranscriber = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", model=\"openai/whisper-base.en\")\n\ndef transcribe(audio):\n    sr, y = audio\n    \n    # Convert to mono if stereo\n    if y.ndim > 1:\n        y = y.mean(axis=1)\n        \n    y = y.astype(np.float32)\n    y /= np.max(np.abs(y))\n\n    return transcriber({\"sampling_rate\": sr, \"raw\": y})[\"text\"]  \n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    transcribe,\n    gr.Audio(sources=\"microphone\"),\n    \"text\",\n    api_name=\"predict\",\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/asr'></gradio-app>\n\nThe `transcribe` function takes a single parameter, `audio`, which is a numpy array of the audio the user recorded. The `pipeline` object expects this in float32 format, so we convert it first to float32, and then extract the transcribed text.\n\n## 3. Create a Streaming ASR Demo with Transformers\n\nTo make this a *streaming* demo, we need to make these changes:\n\n1. Set `streaming=True` in the `Audio` component\n2. Set `live=True` in the `Interface`\n3. Add a `state` to the interface to store the recorded audio of a user\n            <div class='tip'>\n                <span class=\"inline-flex\" style=\"align-items: baseline\">\n                    <svg class=\"self-center w-5 h-5 mx-1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"800px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"currentColor\">\n                        <path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M9.25 18.7089C9.25 18.2894 9.58579 17.9494 10 17.9494H14C14.4142 17.9494 14.75 18.2894 14.75 18.7089C14.75 19.1283 14.4142 19.4684 14 19.4684H10C9.58579 19.4684 9.25 19.1283 9.25 18.7089ZM9.91667 21.2405C9.91667 20.821 10.2525 20.481 10.6667 20.481H13.3333C13.7475 20.481 14.0833 20.821 14.0833 21.2405C14.0833 21.66 13.7475 22 13.3333 22H10.6667C10.2525 22 9.91667 21.66 9.91667 21.2405Z\"/>\n                        <path d=\"M7.41058 13.8283L8.51463 14.8807C8.82437 15.1759 9 15.5875 9 16.0182C9 16.6653 9.518 17.1899 10.157 17.1899H13.843C14.482 17.1899 15 16.6653 15 16.0182C15 15.5875 15.1756 15.1759 15.4854 14.8807L16.5894 13.8283C18.1306 12.3481 18.9912 10.4034 18.9999 8.3817L19 8.29678C19 4.84243 15.866 2 12 2C8.13401 2 5 4.84243 5 8.29678L5.00007 8.3817C5.00875 10.4034 5.86939 12.3481 7.41058 13.8283Z\"/>\n                    </svg>\n                <span><strong>Tip:</strong></span>\n                </span>\n                <p>You can also set <code>time_limit</code> and <code>stream_every</code> parameters in the interface. The <code>time_limit</code> caps the amount of time each user's stream can take. The default is 30 seconds so users won't be able to stream audio for more than 30 seconds. The <code>stream_every</code> parameter controls how frequently data is sent to your function. By default it is 0.5 seconds.</p>\n            </div>\n                \n\nTake a look below.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport numpy as np\n\ntranscriber = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", model=\"openai/whisper-base.en\")\n\ndef transcribe(stream, new_chunk):\n    sr, y = new_chunk\n    \n    # Convert to mono if stereo\n    if y.ndim > 1:\n        y = y.mean(axis=1)\n        \n    y = y.astype(np.float32)\n    y /= np.max(np.abs(y))\n\n    if stream is not None:\n        stream = np.concatenate([stream, y])\n    else:\n        stream = y\n    return stream, transcriber({\"sampling_rate\": sr, \"raw\": stream})[\"text\"]  \n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    transcribe,\n    [\"state\", gr.Audio(sources=[\"microphone\"], streaming=True)],\n    [\"state\", \"text\"],\n    live=True,\n    api_name=\"predict\"\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nNotice that we now have a state variable because we need to track all the audio history. `transcribe` gets called whenever there is a new small chunk of audio, but we also need to keep track of all the audio spoken so far in the state. As the interface runs, the `transcribe` function gets called, with a record of all the previously spoken audio in the `stream` and the new chunk of audio as `new_chunk`. We return the new full audio to be stored back in its current state, and we also return the transcription. Here, we naively append the audio together and call the `transcriber` object on the entire audio. You can imagine more efficient ways of handling this, such as re-processing only the last 5 seconds of audio whenever a new chunk of audio is received. \n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/stream_asr'></gradio-app>\n\nNow the ASR model will run inference as you speak! \n", "tags": ["ASR", "SPEECH", "STREAMING"], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/real-time-speech-recognition/", "contributor": null}}
