Introduction
============

This package contains fields and wrapper objects for storing:

* A file with a filename
* An image with a filename

Blob-based and non-blob-based types are provided. The blob-based types
require the ZODB3 package to be at version 3.8.1 or later,
and BLOBs to be configured in zope.conf.

plone.supermodel handlers are registered.

See the `image handling section of Plone documentation <https://6.docs.plone.org/classic-ui/images.html#all-image-scales-in-the-srcset>`_ to learn how to
use the features provided by this package.

  Fixes `issue 147 <https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/issues/147>`_.
  [mliebischer] (#147)


6.1.1 (2023-06-22)

- Fix picture tag when original image is used instead of a scale.
  [maurits] (#142)


6.0.1 (2023-03-14)
------------------

Tests

6.0.0 (2022-11-22)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Log a warning when a scale for a picture variant is not found.
  Until now this gave an exception.
  [maurits] (#134)
- Prevent exception when an anonymous user is the first to load a page with a private image.
  Anonymous still gets an Unauthorized when loading the image, but that is to be expected.
  The html at least shows normally.
  Fixes `issue 135 <https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/issues/135>`_.
  [maurits] (#135)
- Fixed writing to the database each time an original is requested.

  Prevents a traceback when the context is a tile.
  When no title can we found, fall back to an empty string.
  [maurits] (#128)


6.0.0b2 (2022-06-27)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- Do not use full url in `image_scales` dictionary.
  [petschki] (#123)


6.0.0b1 (2022-06-23)
--------------------

New features:


- Creating a tag no longer generates the actual scale.
  [maurits] (#113)
- Add picture method to to ImageScaling and include it in @@image-test.
  Picture tags only work on Plone 6, with several other branches for picture variants merged.
  See `plip-image-srcsets.cfg <https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/blob/6.0/plips/plip-image-srcsets.cfg>`_.
  If not available (like on Plone 5.2), an ordinary image tag is created.
  [MrTango] (#113)
- Add ``@@images-test`` page for Editors.
  This shows various variants from the image field of the current context.
  It shows a list of stored scales.
  It allows purging the stored scales.
  [maurits] (#113)
- removed marking request for disable CSRF protection (need plone.scale with https://github.com/plone/plone.scale/pull/58)
  [mamico] (#177)
- use the attribute _sizes for local caching correctly available_sizes
  [mamico] (#177)
- add additional infos in scale storage only if missing
  [mamico] (#177)
- Register adapter for image fields to the new image_scales metadata.
  Use this in the image_scale view to get images from a list a brains.
  This code is not active on Plone 5, only Plone 6.
  [cekk, maurits] (#3521)


Bug fixes:


- Cleanup: isort, black, pyupgrade, remove use of six, etc.
  [maurits] (#120)


6.0.0a4 (2022-05-26)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- Only look at the width when checking if a HiDPI image would be larger than the original.
  Otherwise HiDPI srcsets are never included when the scale is defined with a height of 65536.
  [maurits] (#114)
- Fix Unauthorized when accessing ``@@images/image`` of private image, even as Manager.
  Fixes problem introduced in previous release.
  [maurits] (#118)


6.0.0a3 (2022-02-28)
--------------------

Bug fixes:


- ``ImageScaling`` view: use ``guarded_orig_image`` to get field from a url.
  Mostly, this makes the view easier to customize.
  [maurits] (#104)


6.0.0a2 (2022-02-23)
--------------------

Breaking changes:


- Removed deprecated extras from setup.py.
  These ones are gone now: ``blobs``, ``editor``, ``marshaler``, ``scales``, ``supermodel``.
  See `issue 106 <https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/issues/106>`_.
  [maurits] (#106)


New features:


- Register ``AnnotationStorage`` as ``IImageScaleStorage`` multi adapter.
  Both from ``plone.scale``.
  Use this adapter in our scaling functions when we store or get an image scale.
  [maurits] (#44)


6.0.0a1 (2022-01-28)
--------------------

Breaking changes:


- Drop support for Python 2.7.
  Main target is now Plone 6, but we try to keep it running on Plone 5.2 with Python 3.
  See discussion in `plone.scale issue 44 <https://github.com/plone/plone.scale/issues/44>`_.
  [maurits] (#44)


Bug fixes:


- Fixed NameError `file` on Python 3. Use `io.IOBase` instead. (#3)


5.6.0 (2021-12-29)
------------------

New features:


- Make DefaultImageScalingFactory more flexible, with methods you can override.
  [maurits] (#104)


5.5.1 (2021-07-28)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Cache stable image scales strongly.
  When plone.app.imaging is available, this is already done.
  Otherwise, we should do this ourselves.
  Fixes `issue 100 <https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/issues/100>`_.
  [maurits] (#100)


5.5.0 (2021-06-30)
------------------

New features:


- Prevent stored XSS from file upload (svg, html).
  Do this by implementing an allowlist of trusted mimetypes.
  You can turn this around by using a denylist of just svg, html and javascript.
  Do this by setting OS environment variable ``NAMEDFILE_USE_DENYLIST=1``.
  From `Products.PloneHotfix20210518 <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518/reflected-xss-in-various-spots>`_.

Bug fixes:


- Fix image scaling to reuse the original image when scaling is not required to allow Plone REST API to use cacheable scale URL for the original image without performance penalty [datakurre] (#92)


5.3.0 (2020-04-21)
------------------

New features:


- Change to use field value _p_mtime instead of context object _p_mtime as image scale invalidation timestamp to fix issue where context object (e.g. a document with lead image) modification invalidated all its image field scales even the images itself were not modified. [datakurre] (#91)


5.2.2 (2020-04-14)

------------------

New features:


- Add new interface ``plone.namedfile.interfaces.IPluggableFileFieldValidation`` and ``plone.namedfile.interfaces.IPluggableImageFieldValidation``.
  Refactored: the fields validation now looks for adapters with this interfaces adapting field and value.
  All found adapters are called.
  The image content type checker (existed before) is by now the only adapter implemented and registered so far.
  Other adapters can be registered in related or custom code.
  [jensens] (#81)


5.0.5 (2019-10-12)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- fix ResourceWarnings for unclosed files
  [mamico] (#80)

  https://github.com/plone/plone.namedfile/pull/56
  [jensens]


4.2.2 (2017-07-03)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Don't break DefaultImageScalingFactory, if for any reason the fieldname isn't available on the context.
  [thet]

- Different caching keys for different domains
  [mamico]


4.2.1 (2017-05-30)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Fix #46, when ``process_png``, ``process_jpeg`` and ``process_tiff`` could fail with a ``width referenced before assignment`` error.
  [thet]

  Based on piexif library and ideas of maartenkling and ezvirtual.
  Chosen piexif as it allow read and write of exif data for future enhancements.
  http://piexif.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
  For Orientation examples and description see http://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2012/07/28/exif-orientation-handling-is-a-ghetto/ test data https://github.com/recurser/exif-orientation-examples

----------------

New features:

- Add Pdata storage
  [vangheem]


4.0 (2016-08-12)
----------------

Incompatibilities:

- Targets Plone 5.1 only, coredev 5.0 and 4.3 are on 3.0.x branch [jensens]:

  - ``plone.supermodel``, ``plone.scale`` and ``plone.schemaeditor`` are now hard dependencies.
    The extras  in setup.py are kept for bbb reasons, but are empty.
    Conditional code is now no longer conditional.
    This simplifies the code a lot.

  - ``zope.app.file`` is no longer hard dependency.
    If it is there, its FileChunk implementation is still checked for, otherwise not.


New:

- uses adapter as factory for scales as in plone.scale>=1.5
  [jensens]

Fixes:

- Several tests were failing on Windows 10 due to binary files being opened in text mode. Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

  uncommitted blob.
  Fixes an error on Windows 10 "WindowsError 32" by attempting to delete or access a file in use
  by another process.
  [smcmahon]

- Fix tests to work with latest plone.scale changes, where gif images are no longer converted to jpeg.
  [thet]

  [jensens]

- Fixed test isolation problem in ``test_blobfile.py``.
  [jensens]

- Fix warning on testing.zcml missing an i18n:domain.
  [gforcada]

- Fix some code analysis warnings.
  [gforcada]

------------------

Fixes:

- PEP 8, UTF-8 headers, implements/adapts to decorators, doctest formatting.
  [thet, jensens]

  [andreesg]


3.0.7 (2016-02-12)
------------------

Fixes:

- Make plone.protect a soft dependency. This allows to use this package in
  setups without the Plone stack. Fixes plone/Products.CMFPlone#1311
  [thet]

3.0.6 (2016-01-08)
------------------

Fixes:

- Stabilised tests.  [gotcha]

  https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/1251
  [maurits]


3.0.4 (2015-10-28)
------------------

Fixes:

- No longer rely on deprecated ``bobobase_modification_time`` from
  ``Persistence.Persistent``.
  [thet]


3.0.3 (2015-08-14)
------------------

- Don't fail, when accessing the ``tag`` method of the ``@@images`` view, if
  ``scale`` returns ``None``.
  [thet]


3.0.2 (2015-03-13)
------------------

- Cache image scales using the plone.stableResource ruleset when they are
  accessed via UID-based URLs. (Requires plone.app.imaging >= 1.1.0)
  [davisagli]


3.0.1 (2014-10-23)
------------------

- Fixed inserting filename in Content-Disposition header.
  [kroman0]

- Respect field level security in download views also for primary fields.
  [jensens]

- Internationalize field factory label.
  [thomasdesvenain]


3.0.0 (2014-04-13)
------------------

- Disable CSRF protection when creating a scale so we can write to the database
  [vangheem]


2.0.5 (2014-02-19)
------------------

- Ensure zope.app.file.file module alias is created before its use in
  file package.
  [thomasdesvenain]


2.0.4 (2014-01-27)
------------------

- Disable CSRF protection when creating a scale so we can write to the database
  [vangheem]

- Validate image field : check if content is actually an image using mimetype.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Fix: get_contenttype works when empty string is given as contentType.

- Backward compatibility of NamedFile with zope.app.file FileChunk.
  Avoids NamedFile validation unexpected failures.
  [thomasdesvenain]


2.0.5 (2014-02-19)
------------------

- Ensure zope.app.file.file module alias is created before its use in
  file package.
  [thomasdesvenain]


2.0.4 (2014-01-27)
------------------

- Backward compatibility of NamedFile with zope.app.file FileChunk.
  Avoids NamedFile validation unexpected failures.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Validate image field : check if content is actually an image using mimetype.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- Fix: get_contenttype works when empty string is given as contentType.
  [thomasdesvenain]


2.0.3 (2013-12-07)
------------------

- Scaling Traverser now does not try to traverse two steps in one.
  This is impossible in chameleon.
  [do3cc]


2.0.2 (2013-05-23)
------------------

* Use plone.app.imaging's (>=1.0.8) quality setting if it exists.
  https://dev.plone.org/ticket/13337
  [khink]

* fix invalidation on contexts that do not implement dublin core; Notably
  portlet assignments. Fallback is bobo_modification_time. Maybe portlet
  assignments should implement modified() instead?
  [tmog]

* Fixed handling of TTW Dexterity content type image field
  data when image data is large and stored as
  zope.app.file.file.FileChunk in ZODB instead of raw string data.
  Issue appearated after Plone 4.3 migration [miohtama]


2.0.1 (2013-01-17)
------------------

* Add direction parameter support in scaling (was ignored in tag and scale
  functions).
  Now calling tag function with parameter direction='down' crops the image.
  direction='thumbnail' by default so default behaviour remains the same.
  [jriboux]

2.0 (2012-08-29)
----------------

* Move file and image value implementations here instead of extending
  the ones from zope.app.file and z3c.blobfile. This helps tame a mess
  of dependencies.
  [davisagli]

* The blob-based file and image implementations are now always available.
  (But they will only work if Zope is using a storage with blob support.)
  [davisagli]

* Add support for HEAD requests to @@images view
  [anthonygerrard]

* Add hook to override headers in subclasses of file download view

  [davisagli]

1.0.2 - 2011-05-19
------------------

* Don't omit empty string attributes from ImageScale tag.
  [elro]

1.0.1 - 2011-05-19
------------------

  filenames.
  [davisagli]

1.0 - 2011-04-30
----------------

* Use unique urls for accessing the original scale.
  [elro]

* Avoid Content-Disposition for image scales.
  [elro]

1.0b8 - 2011-04-12
------------------

* Declare dependency on plone.rfc822 >= 1.0b2 (for IPrimaryField).
  [davisagli]

* Add a @@display-file view which doesn't set Content-Disposition, so we don't
  force download of images, for example.
  [lentinj]

1.0b7 - 2011-03-22
------------------

* Support getting the original size as a scale.
  [elro]

------------------

* Add primary field support to @@download and @@images views.
  [elro]

* Add getAvailableSizes and getImageSize to the @@images view.
  [elro]

1.0b5 - 2010-04-19
------------------

* Add support for scaled images.  See usage.txt for details.
  [davisagli]

* Fix the field schemata so they can be used as the form schema when
  adding the field using plone.schemaeditor.
  [rossp]

1.0b4 - 2009-11-17
------------------

* Avoid using the internal _current_filename() helper, which disappeared in
  ZODB 3.9.
  [optilude]

* Add field factories for plone.schemaeditor (only installed if
  plone.schemaeditor is available)
  [davisagli]

1.0b3 - 2009-10-08
------------------

* Add plone.rfc822 field marshaler (only installed if plone.rfc822 is
  available)
  [optilude]

1.0b2 - 2009-09-17
------------------

* Add plone.supermodel import/export handlers (only installed if
  plone.supermodel is available).
  [optilude]

1.0b1 - 2009-05-30
------------------

* Make z3c.blobfile (and blobs in general) a soft dependency. You'll need to
  separately depend on z3c.blobfile (and probably pin it to version 0.1.2) to
  get the NamedBlobFile and NamedBlobImage fields. This means that
  plone.namedfile can be used with ZODB versions that do not support BLOBs.
  This policy will probably be revisited for a 2.0 release.
  [optilude]

1.0a1 - 2009-04-17
------------------

* Initial release

Usage
=====

This demonstrates how to use the package.

Schema fields
-------------

The following schema fields can be used to describe file data. We'll only
test the BLOB versions of the fields if z3c.blobfile is installed::

    >>> from zope.interface import Interface
    >>> from plone.namedfile import field

    >>> class IFileContainer(Interface):
    ...     simple = field.NamedFile(title=u"Named file")
    ...     image = field.NamedImage(title=u"Named image file")
    ...     blob = field.NamedBlobFile(title=u"Named blob file")
    ...     blobimage = field.NamedBlobImage(title=u"Named blob image file")

These store data with the following types::

    >>> from zope.interface import implementer
    >>> from plone import namedfile


    >>> @implementer(IFileContainer)
    ... class FileContainer(object):
    ...     __allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__ = 1
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.simple = namedfile.NamedFile()
    ...         self.image = namedfile.NamedImage()
    ...         self.blob = namedfile.NamedBlobFile()
    ...         self.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage()
    ...
    ...     def absolute_url(self):
    ...         return "http://foo/bar"


File data and content type
--------------------------

Let's now show how to get and set file data.

The FileContainer class creates empty objects to start with::

    >>> container = FileContainer()

    >>> bytearray(container.simple.data)
    bytearray(b'')
    >>> container.simple.contentType
    ''
    >>> container.simple.filename is None
    True

    >>> len(container.image.data)
    0
    >>> container.image.contentType
    ''
    >>> container.image.filename is None
    True

    >>> len(container.blob.data)
    0
    >>> container.blob.contentType
    ''
    >>> container.blob.filename is None
    True
    >>> len(container.blobimage.data)
    0
    >>> container.blobimage.contentType
    ''
    >>> container.blobimage.filename is None
    True

Let's now set some actual data in these files. Notice how the constructor
will attempt to guess the filename from the file extension::

    >>> container.simple = namedfile.NamedFile('dummy test data', filename=u"test.txt")
    >>> bytearray(container.simple.data)
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> container.simple.contentType
    'text/plain'
    >>> print(container.simple.filename)
    test.txt

    >>> container.blob = namedfile.NamedBlobFile('dummy test data', filename=u"test.txt")
    >>> bytearray(container.blob.data)
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> container.blob.contentType
    'text/plain'
    >>> print(container.blob.filename)
    test.txt

Let's also try to read a GIF, courtesy of the zope.app.file tests::

    >>> zptlogo = (
    ...     b'GIF89a\x10\x00\x10\x00\xd5\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xfc\xfd\xfd'
    ...     b'\xfa\xfb\xfc\xf7\xf9\xfa\xf5\xf8\xf9\xf3\xf6\xf8\xf2\xf5\xf7\xf0\xf4\xf6'
    ...     b'\xeb\xf1\xf3\xe5\xed\xef\xde\xe8\xeb\xdc\xe6\xea\xd9\xe4\xe8\xd7\xe2\xe6'
    ...     b'\xd2\xdf\xe3\xd0\xdd\xe3\xcd\xdc\xe1\xcb\xda\xdf\xc9\xd9\xdf\xc8\xd8\xdd'
    ...     b'\xc6\xd7\xdc\xc4\xd6\xdc\xc3\xd4\xda\xc2\xd3\xd9\xc1\xd3\xd9\xc0\xd2\xd9'
    ...     b'\xbd\xd1\xd8\xbd\xd0\xd7\xbc\xcf\xd7\xbb\xcf\xd6\xbb\xce\xd5\xb9\xcd\xd4'
    ...     b'\xb6\xcc\xd4\xb6\xcb\xd3\xb5\xcb\xd2\xb4\xca\xd1\xb2\xc8\xd0\xb1\xc7\xd0'
    ...     b'\xb0\xc7\xcf\xaf\xc6\xce\xae\xc4\xce\xad\xc4\xcd\xab\xc3\xcc\xa9\xc2\xcb'
    ...     b'\xa8\xc1\xca\xa6\xc0\xc9\xa4\xbe\xc8\xa2\xbd\xc7\xa0\xbb\xc5\x9e\xba\xc4'
    ...     b'\x9b\xbf\xcc\x98\xb6\xc1\x8d\xae\xbaFgs\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    ...     b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    ...     b'\x00,\x00\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00\x10\x00\x00\x06z@\x80pH,\x12k\xc8$\xd2f\x04'
    ...     b'\xd4\x84\x01\x01\xe1\xf0d\x16\x9f\x80A\x01\x91\xc0ZmL\xb0\xcd\x00V\xd4'
    ...     b'\xc4a\x87z\xed\xb0-\x1a\xb3\xb8\x95\xbdf8\x1e\x11\xca,MoC$\x15\x18{'
    ...     b'\x006}m\x13\x16\x1a\x1f\x83\x85}6\x17\x1b $\x83\x00\x86\x19\x1d!%)\x8c'
    ...     b'\x866#\'+.\x8ca`\x1c`(,/1\x94B5\x19\x1e"&*-024\xacNq\xba\xbb\xb8h\xbeb'
    ...     b'\x00A\x00;'
    ...     )

    >>> container.image = namedfile.NamedImage(zptlogo, filename=u"zpt.gif")
    >>> container.image.data == zptlogo
    True
    >>> container.image.contentType
    'image/gif'
    >>> print(container.image.filename)
    zpt.gif

    >>> container.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage(zptlogo, filename=u"zpt.gif")
    >>> container.blobimage.data == zptlogo
    True
    >>> container.blobimage.contentType
    'image/gif'
    >>> print(container.blobimage.filename)
    zpt.gif

Note that is possible for force the mimetype::

    >>> container.image = namedfile.NamedImage(zptlogo, contentType='image/foo', filename=u"zpt.gif")
    >>> container.image.data == zptlogo
    True
    >>> container.image.contentType
    'image/foo'
    >>> print(container.image.filename)
    zpt.gif

    >>> container.blobimage = namedfile.NamedBlobImage(zptlogo, contentType='image/foo', filename=u"zpt.gif")
    >>> container.blobimage.data == zptlogo
    True
    >>> container.blobimage.contentType
    'image/foo'
    >>> print(container.blobimage.filename)
    zpt.gif

The filename must be set to a unicode string, not a bytestring::

    >>> container.image.filename = b'foo'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    zope.schema._bootstrapinterfaces.WrongType: ...


Restricting media types
-----------------------

It is possible to define accepted media types, just like with the "accept"
attribute of HTML file inputs. You can pass a tuple of file extensions or media
type values::


    >>> class IFileContainerConstrained(Interface):
    ...     file = field.NamedFile(title=u"File", accept=("text/plain", ".pdf"))

    >>> @implementer(IFileContainerConstrained)
    ... class FileContainerConstrained:
    ...     __allow_access_to_unprotected_subobjects__ = 1
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.file = namedfile.NamedFile()

    >>> container_constrained = FileContainerConstrained()


Adding valid file types and checking passes. Note, that the validation logic is
called by the framework and does not need to be called manualle, like in this
test.
::

    >>> container_constrained.file = namedfile.NamedFile(
    ...     'dummy test data',
    ...     filename=u"test.txt"
    ... )
    >>> IFileContainerConstrained["file"].validate(container_constrained.file)

    >>> container_constrained.file = namedfile.NamedFile(
    ...     'dummy test data',
    ...     filename=u"test.pdf"
    ... )
    >>> IFileContainerConstrained["file"].validate(container_constrained.file)

Adding invalid file types and checking fails with a ValidationError::

    >>> container_constrained.file = namedfile.NamedFile(
    ...     'dummy test data',
    ...     filename=u"test.wav"
    ... )
    >>> IFileContainerConstrained["file"].validate(container_constrained.file)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    plone.namedfile.field.InvalidFile: ('audio/x-wav', 'file')


Download view
-------------

This package also comes with a view that can be used to download files. This
will set Content-Disposition to ensure the browser downloads the file rather
than displaying it. To use it, link to ../context-object/@@download/fieldname,
where `fieldname` is the name of the attribute on the context-object where the
named file is stored.

We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::

    >>> from plone.namedfile.browser import Download
    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'simple')
    >>> bytearray(download())
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '15'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'text/plain'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Link')
    '<http://foo/bar/@@download/simple/test.txt>; rel="canonical"'

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blob')
    >>> data = download()
    >>> bytearray(hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data)
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '15'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'text/plain'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Link')
    '<http://foo/bar/@@download/blob/test.txt>; rel="canonical"'

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'image')
    >>> download() == zptlogo
    True

    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '341'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'image/foo'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Link')
    '<http://foo/bar/@@download/image/zpt.gif>; rel="canonical"'

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
    >>> data = download()
    >>> (hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data) == zptlogo
    True
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '341'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'image/foo'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Link')
    '<http://foo/bar/@@download/blobimage/zpt.gif>; rel="canonical"'

Range support
-------------

Checking for partial requests support::

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
    >>> data = download()
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '341'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Accept-Ranges')
    'bytes'

Request a specific range::

    >>> request = TestRequest(environ={'HTTP_RANGE': 'bytes=0-99'})
    >>> download = Download(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
    >>> data = download()
    >>> request.response.getStatus()
    206
    >>> len(hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data)
    100

The Content-Length header now indicates the size of the requested range (and not the full size of the image).
The Content-Range response header indicates where in the full resource this partial message belongs.::

    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '100'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Range')
    'bytes 0-99/341'


Display-file view
-----------------

This package also comes with a view that can be used to display files in the
browser. To use it, link to ../context-object/@@display-file/fieldname, where
`fieldname` is the name of the attribute on the context-object where the named
file is stored.

We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::

    >>> from plone.namedfile.browser import DisplayFile
    >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'simple')
    >>> bytearray(display_file())
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '15'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'text/plain'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blob')
    >>> data = display_file()
    >>> bytearray(hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data)
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '15'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'text/plain'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'image')
    >>> display_file() == zptlogo
    True

    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '341'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'image/foo'

Since the Content-Type is unknown, we do not trust it, and refuse to display inline.
We download instead.

    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> display_file = DisplayFile(container, request).publishTraverse(request, 'blobimage')
    >>> data = display_file()
    >>> (hasattr(data, 'read') and data.read() or data) == zptlogo
    True
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '341'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'image/foo'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''zpt.gif"


Specifying the primary field
----------------------------

To use the @@download view without specifying the field in the URL, the
primary field information must be registered with an adapter. (Frameworks such
as plone.dexterity may already have done this for you.)::

    >>> from plone.rfc822.interfaces import IPrimaryFieldInfo
    >>> from zope.component import adapter

    >>> @implementer(IPrimaryFieldInfo)
    ... @adapter(IFileContainer)
    ... class FieldContainerPrimaryFieldInfo(object):
    ...     fieldname = 'simple'
    ...     field = IFileContainer['simple']
    ...     def __init__(self, context):
    ...         self.value = context.simple

    >>> from zope.component import getSiteManager
    >>> components = getSiteManager()
    >>> components.registerAdapter(FieldContainerPrimaryFieldInfo)

We will test this with a dummy request, faking traversal::

    >>> request = TestRequest()
    >>> download = Download(container, request)
    >>> bytearray(download())
    bytearray(b'dummy test data')
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Length')
    '15'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Type')
    'text/plain'
    >>> request.response.getHeader('Content-Disposition')
    "attachment; filename*=UTF-8''test.txt"
