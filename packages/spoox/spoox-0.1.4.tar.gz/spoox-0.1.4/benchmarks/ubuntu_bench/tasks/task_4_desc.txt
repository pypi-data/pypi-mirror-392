There is a simple server implemented in hello_world_server.
The current implementation is buggy and unfinished.
Rather than fixing it, I’d prefer to migrate to a Flask-based solution.
The Flask server should replicate the behavior of the existing one.
Please implement and run a Flask server in the background.
