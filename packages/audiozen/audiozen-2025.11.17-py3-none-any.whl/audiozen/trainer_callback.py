class TrainerCallback:
    """Base class for all callbacks.

    Callbacks are objects that can customize the behavior of the training loop in the Trainer that can inspect the
    training loop state (for progress reporting, logging on TensorBoard or other ML platforms…) and do some actions at
    specific points in the training loop (for example, pruning the model).

    Note:
        1. For the most cases, callbacks are **"read only"** pieces of code, apart from the `TrainerControl` object
           they return, they cannot change anything in the training loop. For customizations that require changes in
           the training loop, you should subclass Trainer and override the methods you need.
        2. The trainer instance is stored in `self.trainer`. This is different from the `Trainer` class. Although we
           don't recommend it, you can also use it to change the model, the optimizer, or the learning rate scheduler.
           If you do so, you should notify in the comment that **the callback is modifying the trainer state** to avoid
           confusion.
