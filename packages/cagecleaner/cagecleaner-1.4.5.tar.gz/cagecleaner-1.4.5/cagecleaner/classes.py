class Run(ABC):
    """
    This is an abstract class representing a typical CAGEcleaner Run.
    A Run is either a LocalRun or a RemoteRun, depending on the mode in which cblaster was executed.
    It contains an initializer, shared by both LocalRun and RemoteRun, that internally parses and stores the arguments given through the command line.
    The static method fromArgs() is used to initialize a LocalRun or RemoteRun based on the mode of the provided session file.
        
    One can visualize the workflow as follows:
        
       -- Remote -> fetchAssemblyIDs() -> downloadGenomes() -> mapAssembliesToBinary() -> EXTENDED_BINARY -> |
      |                                                                                                      |
