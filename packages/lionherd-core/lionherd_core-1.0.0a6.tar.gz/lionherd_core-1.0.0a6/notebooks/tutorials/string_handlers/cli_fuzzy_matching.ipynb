    "# Tutorial: CLI Command Fuzzy Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: String Handlers\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Intermediate\n",
    "**Time**: 15-20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Command-line interfaces require exact command matching by default - \"git statsu\" fails even though the user clearly meant \"git status\". This creates friction in developer workflows, especially for frequently-used commands with long names or similar spelling. Users must retype the command exactly, interrupting their flow and reducing productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional CLI tools handle typos poorly: they either fail silently with \"command not found\" or require complex shell aliases and autocomplete configurations. What's needed is intelligent typo tolerance that can suggest corrections when the input is \"close enough\" to a valid command, similar to search engines correcting \"recieve\" to \"receive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Typo tolerance reduces frustration and speeds up workflows by suggesting corrections instead of failing\n",
    "- **Discoverability**: Fuzzy matching helps users discover similar commands they might not know about\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Users with dyslexia or motor control issues benefit from tolerant input handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A lightweight CLI command matcher using lionherd-core's `string_similarity` that suggests corrections for typos, handles case variations, and implements configurable auto-correction thresholds in ~20 lines of code."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Levenshtein for General Typo Tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: When users make typos throughout the word (not just at the end), or when prefix matching isn't as important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use Levenshtein edit distance instead of Jaro-Winkler\n",
    "matches = string_similarity(\n",
    "    user_input,\n",

    "# Levenshtein better handles mid-word typos\n",
    "# Example: \"stutus\" → \"status\" (transposition in middle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs**:\n",
    "- ✅ Better for general typos and transpositions\n",
    "- ✅ More intuitive edit distance metric (number of character changes)\n",
    "- ❌ No prefix bias (\"sta\" matches \"status\" and \"restart\" equally)\n",
    "- ❌ Slightly slower than Jaro-Winkler (~2× for typical command lengths)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Multi-Algorithm Consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: High-stakes CLIs (deployment, deletion commands) where incorrect auto-correction is dangerous.\n",

    "    jaro_winkler_similarity,\n",
    "    levenshtein_similarity,\n",

    "### 3. Context-Aware Command History\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: Interactive CLIs where users have command history and patterns.\n",

    "        self.history[command] += 1  # Track usage\n",
    "        print(f\"Running: {command}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "- ✅ Built a fuzzy CLI command matcher using `string_similarity` in ~20 lines\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented threshold-based decision logic (auto-correct vs suggest vs reject)\n",
    "- ✅ Created user-friendly feedback for different typo scenarios\n",
    "- ✅ Understood Jaro-Winkler algorithm's strengths for command matching\n",
    "- ✅ Explored variations for different use cases and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "1. **Jaro-Winkler is ideal for command names**: Prefix-weighted similarity naturally handles how users type commands (correct start, errors toward end)\n",
    "2. **Multiple thresholds enable nuanced UX**: 0.9 for auto-correct (high confidence), 0.7 for suggestions (helpful but not presumptuous), reject below\n",
    "3. **Exact match fast path matters**: Skip fuzzy matching overhead when input is already correct (common case)\n",
    "4. **Transparent corrections build trust**: Always show what was corrected to avoid \"magic\" behavior that confuses users\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "- ✅ CLI tools with >10 commands (typos become likely)\n",
    "- ✅ Commands with similar names (\"start\", \"status\", \"restart\")\n",
    "- ✅ Developer tools where speed matters (avoid retyping)\n",
    "- ✅ Tools with long or complex command names\n",
    "- ❌ Single-command CLIs (no alternatives to suggest)\n",
    "- ❌ Security-critical commands requiring exact match (use strict mode)\n",
    "- ❌ CLIs with strict parsing requirements (flags, arguments need exact match)\n",
