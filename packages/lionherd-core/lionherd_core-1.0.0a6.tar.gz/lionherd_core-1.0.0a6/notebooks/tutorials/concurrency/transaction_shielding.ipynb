    "Database transactions require atomic commit/rollback - either all changes persist or none do. In async applications with cancellation, interrupting a commit corrupts data. lionherd-core's `shield()` creates a cancellation barrier around critical operations.\n",

    "**What You'll Learn**:\n",
    "- Use `shield()` to protect critical finalization\n",
    "- Guarantee atomic commit/rollback under cancellation\n",
    "- Detect cancellation with `is_cancelled()`\n",
    "- Integrate shielding with context managers\n",

    "- ✅ Database commit/rollback (ACID guarantees)\n",
    "- ✅ File write + fsync (partial writes corrupt data)\n",
    "- ✅ Resource cleanup (must release locks, close connections)\n",
    "- ❌ Normal operations (should respect cancellation)\n",
    "- ❌ User-facing operations with timeouts (deadline ignored)"

    "- **Suppression semantics**: `shield()` completely blocks outer cancellation\n",
    "- **Timeout ignored**: After shielded work completes, no exception raised\n",
    "- **Atomic guarantee**: Shielded function runs to completion or fails completely\n",
    "- **Correct usage**: Use in cleanup contexts (`__aexit__`, `finally`) where exception already exists\n",

    "**Important**: In bare usage (example above), the timeout was **suppressed**, not delayed. The `fail_after(0.1)` fired at t=0.1s, but shield blocked it. After completion at t=0.2s, no TimeoutError was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When this is correct**:\n",

User waits 10s\n```\n\n**Alternative: Use move_on_after for graceful degradation:**\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Timeout respected\nwith move_on_after(5.0) as scope:\n    result = await expensive_api_call()\n    if scope.cancelled_caught:\n        result = fallback_value\n```\n\n### Related Resources\n\n- [API Reference: Concurrency Utilities](../../docs/api/libs/concurrency/)\n- [Tutorial: Resource Leak Detection](./)\n- [anyio Cancellation Docs](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cancellation.html)"
