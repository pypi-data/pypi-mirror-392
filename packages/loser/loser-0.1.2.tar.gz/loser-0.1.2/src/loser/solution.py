        Parameters:
        -----------
        distances: numpy.ndarray
            A 2D array where distances[i, j] represents the distance (similarity) between point i and point j.
            NOTE: distances should be in the range [0, 1].
        clusters: numpy.ndarray
            A 1D array where clusters[i] represents the cluster assignment of point i.
        selection_cost: float
            The cost associated with selecting a point.
        cost_per_cluster: int
            Defines how the cost of selecting a point in each cluster is calculated.
            0: Default behavior, set to selection cost.
            1: Set to selection_cost / number of points in cluster.
            2: Set to the average distance in a cluster (average distance of all points in the cluster to the centroid of the cluster).
            3: Set to the average distance in a cluster (average distance of all points in the cluster to the closest point in the cluster).
        max_fraction: float
            The maximum fraction of points to select (0-1].
            NOTE: If smaller than 1 divided by the number of clusters,

        seed: int, optional
            Random seed for reproducibility.

            NOTE: If set to false, doubleswaps will always be checked
            and all moves are assigned equal probability.
        max_move_queue_size: int
            The maximum number of moves to keep track of in the recent moves queue.
        min_doubleswaps: int
            The minimum number of doubleswaps in the last max_move_queue_size moves
            before doubleswaps are omitted.
        start_p: float
            The starting probability for testing a doubleswap move.
            NOTE: This probability should be larger than 1/4 to ensure that
            doubleswaps are test enough to conclude that they can be

            The rate at which the probability for testing a doubleswap move decays.
            NOTE: This should be a small positive number, e.g. 0.01.

            The time taken for each iteration.
            NOTE: this is primarily for logging purposes
        objectives: list of floats
            The objective value in each iteration.
