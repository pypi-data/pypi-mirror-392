Welcome.

At heart, SingleM is a tool for profiling shotgun (both short and long-read) metagenomes. It [shows](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.30.578060) good accuracy in estimating the relative abundances of community members, and has a particular strength in dealing with novel lineages.

It was originally designed to determine the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal taxa in a sample. Microbial SingleM has been applied to ~700,000 public metagenomes. The resulting data are available at the [Sandpiper companion website](https://sandpiper.qut.edu.au).

Recent versions have added features:
* Long-read input support (v0.20.0). Either Nanopore >= R10.4.1 or PacBio HiFi reads are recommended to ensure reliable taxonomic profiling.
* Profiling of dsDNA phages (v0.19.0, updated DB in v0.20.0). See [Lyrebird](https://wwood.github.io/singlem/Lyrebird).

The method it uses also it suitable for some related tasks, such as assessing eukaryotic contamination, finding bias in genome recovery, and lineage-targeted MAG recovery. It can also be used as the basis for choosing metagenomes which, when coassembled, maximise the recovery of novel MAGs (see [Bin Chicken](https://aroneys.github.io/binchicken/)).
