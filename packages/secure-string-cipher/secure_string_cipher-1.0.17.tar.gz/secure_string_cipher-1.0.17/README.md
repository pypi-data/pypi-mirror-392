A simple, secure AES-256-GCM encryption tool with an interactive menu interface.

**Python Requirements:** 3.12+ (developed on 3.14)

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text and files with AES-256-GCM
- **Inline passphrase generation** – Type `/gen` at any password prompt to instantly generate a strong passphrase
- Generate strong random passphrases with entropy calculation
- Store passphrases in an encrypted vault (optional)
  - HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification to detect tampering
  - Automatic backup creation (keeps last 5 backups)
  - Atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Stream large files in chunks for low memory usage
- Text output in Base64 for easy copy/paste
- Clipboard integration available

## Installation

> **Note**: Requires **Python 3.12 or newer**. Python 3.10 and 3.11 are no longer supported as of version 1.0.16.

```bash
# Recommended: install with pipx
pipx install secure-string-cipher

# Or with pip
pip install secure-string-cipher

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
pip install .
```

## Usage

Run the interactive CLI:

```bash
cipher-start
```

You'll see this menu:

### Quick Passphrase Generation

When prompted for a password during encryption, you can type `/gen` (or `/generate` or `/g`) to instantly generate a strong passphrase:

```
Enter passphrase: /gen

🔑 Auto-Generating Secure Passphrase...

✅ Generated Passphrase:
8w@!-@_#M)wF,Qn(ms.Uv+3z

Entropy: 155.0 bits

💾 Store this passphrase in vault? (y/n) [n]: y
Enter a label for this passphrase: backup-2025
Enter master password to encrypt vault: ••••••••••••
✅ Passphrase 'backup-2025' stored in vault!

✅ Using this passphrase for current operation...
```

This feature:
- Generates alphanumeric passphrases with symbols (155+ bits entropy)
- Optionally stores the passphrase in your encrypted vault
- Skips confirmation since you already saw the generated password
- Works seamlessly without leaving the encryption flow

### Passphrase Vault Workflows

- **Auto-store prompt (option 5 or `/gen`):** Every time you generate a passphrase—either from menu option 5 or by typing `/gen` at a password prompt—the CLI immediately offers to store it in the vault. Answer `y` and you will be asked for a label plus the vault's master password; the passphrase is encrypted and written to `~/.secure-cipher/passphrase_vault.enc` with backups in `~/.secure-cipher/backups/`.
- **Manual storage (option 6):** Already have a passphrase you want to save? Choose option 6 to provide the label, passphrase, and master password manually.
- **Retrieval & maintenance (options 7-9):** Fetch stored secrets, list all labels, or update/delete entries without leaving the CLI. All operations require the master password and enforce vault integrity checks (HMAC + automatic backups).

### Upgrading

Use pipx (recommended) or pip to upgrade to the latest released build:

```bash
pipx upgrade secure-string-cipher
# or
pip install --upgrade secure-string-cipher
```

Verify the version that is installed:

```bash
pip show secure-string-cipher | grep Version
```

Release 1.0.17 (and newer) includes the inline `/gen` prompt plus the vault menu actions described above. If `pip` reports you are already up to date but you are missing these features, ensure you are pointing at the same Python interpreter that runs `cipher-start` and rerun the upgrade command.

## Docker

Use the pre-built image (Python 3.14-alpine based):

```bash
# Pull and run
docker pull ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest

# Or with Docker Compose
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec cipher cipher-start
```

To encrypt files in your current directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/data" \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

With persistent vault and backups:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data" \
  -v "$PWD/vault:/vault" \
  -v "$PWD/backups:/backups" \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

**Image details:** ~65MB Alpine-based image, Python 3.14, runs as non-root user (UID 1000), network-isolated, includes HMAC integrity verification and automatic backups (last 5 kept).

## Security

- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
- **Key derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (390,000 iterations)
- **Passphrase vault:** Encrypted with AES-256-GCM using your master password
- **Vault integrity:** HMAC-SHA256 verification detects file tampering
- **Automatic backups:** Last 5 vault backups saved in `~/.secure-cipher/backups/`
- **File permissions:** Vault files are user-only (chmod 600)
- **Password requirements:** Minimum 12 characters with complexity checks

## Development

pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Format code before committing
make format

# Run the full test suite
make ci
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make format      # Auto-format code with Ruff
make lint        # Check formatting, types, and code quality
make test        # Run test suite
make test-cov    # Run tests with coverage report
make clean       # Remove temporary files
make ci          # Run complete CI pipeline locally
```

### Tools

- **Ruff** – Fast linter and formatter (replaces Black, isort, flake8)
- **mypy** – Static type checking
- **pytest** – Testing framework with 150+ tests

Run `make format` before pushing, then `make ci` to verify everything passes.
