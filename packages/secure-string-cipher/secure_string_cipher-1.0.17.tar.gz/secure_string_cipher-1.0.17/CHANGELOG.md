## [1.0.17] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- CLI auto-store prompt now ships in a public release. Whenever you generate a passphrase (option 5 or `/gen`), you can immediately encrypt it into the vault without leaving the workflow.
- README now documents the full vault flow (options 5-9), highlights the integrity safeguards, and explains how to upgrade/verify that this build is installed.

### Details
- **Testing Improvements**:
  - Added focused CLI unit tests to verify the inline "save to vault" workflow.
  - Hardened the secure temp file test so it reliably simulates unwritable directories even when the suite runs as root.
  - **Security Fix**: Fixed `secure_atomic_write()` to handle PermissionError when checking file existence in unreadable directories (Python 3.12 compatibility)
  - **UX Enhancement**: Type `/gen`, `/generate`, or `/g` at any password prompt to instantly generate a strong passphrase
  - **Seamless Workflow**: No need to exit encryption flow to generate passwords
  - **Auto-generation**: Creates alphanumeric passphrases with symbols (155+ bits entropy)
  - **Optional Vault Storage**: Immediately save generated passphrases to encrypted vault
  - **Smart Confirmation**: Auto-generated passwords skip confirmation prompt (user already saw it)
  - **Security**: Only generates passphrases meeting all password strength requirements
  - **Testing**: Added 6 comprehensive integration tests covering all inline generation scenarios
  - **Documentation**: Updated README with quick start guide and example workflow

- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Added continue loop for multiple operations without restart
  - Implemented password retry with 5-attempt limit and rate limiting
  - Added clipboard integration for encrypted/decrypted output

- **Vault Security & UI Polish**: Enhanced vault integrity and menu rendering
  - **Vault Security Features**:
    - Added HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification to detect vault file tampering
    - Automatic backup creation before vault modifications (keeps last 5 backups)
    - Atomic writes using `secure_atomic_write()` to prevent file corruption
    - Enhanced error messages distinguish between wrong password and file tampering
    - Added `list_backups()` and `restore_from_backup()` methods for recovery
    - Backward compatible with legacy vaults (no HMAC → with HMAC migration)
    - Backups stored in `~/.secure-cipher/backups/` with same permissions (chmod 600)
  - **Menu Rendering Improvements**:
    - Added `wcwidth>=0.2.0` dependency for proper Unicode width calculation
    - Fixed menu title alignment (emoji characters now properly centered)
    - Future-proof support for any Unicode/emoji characters
    - Handles CJK characters and combining characters correctly
  - **Documentation Updates**:
    - Updated SECURITY.md with vault integrity and backup features
    - Updated README.md with HMAC verification and backup information
    - Fixed README menu spacing to match actual CLI output
  - **Code Quality**:
    - Fixed trailing whitespace in passphrase_manager.py
    - All 189 tests passing, vault integrity verified
  - **Development Strategy Update**:
    - **Primary development target**: Python 3.14 (latest stable)
    - **Backward compatibility**: Maintained to Python 3.10+
    - **CI/CD Optimization**:
      - Split quality checks (2-3 min) from test matrix (3-5 min) for faster feedback
      - Parallel test execution with `pytest-xdist` (~32% faster)
      - Early failure detection (`--maxfail=3`)
      - Tests run on Python 3.10-3.14 to ensure backward compatibility
    - **Rationale**: Python 3.10/3.11 are in security-only mode (not active development)
    - PyPI classifier shows Python 3.14 as primary, `requires-python = ">=3.10"` for compatibility
    - Ruff configured for `target-version = "py314"` for modern Python features
  - **Docker Improvements**:
    - Updated Dockerfile to Python 3.14-alpine base image
    - Added backup directory creation (`/home/cipheruser/.secure-cipher/backups`)
    - Added runtime dependencies (libffi, openssl) and build dependencies (cargo, rust)
    - Added comprehensive OCI labels for better metadata
    - Added health check for container monitoring
    - Improved security with proper ownership and cache cleanup
    - Updated docker-compose.yml to modern Compose Specification (no version field)
    - Added resource limits and security constraints (cap_drop, cap_add)
    - Added persistent volume mapping to `$HOME/.secure-cipher-docker`
    - Updated release workflow to build multi-arch images (amd64, arm64)
    - Automated Docker image publishing to GHCR on release tags

## 1.0.1 (2025-11-05)

- **Command rename**: CLI command changed from `secure-string-cipher` to `cipher-start` for easier invocation
- Updated README with correct command usage

## 1.0.0 (2025-11-05)

- CLI testability: `main()` accepts optional `in_stream` and `out_stream` file-like parameters so tests can pass StringIO objects and reliably capture I/O.
- CLI exit control: add `exit_on_completion` (default True). When False, `main()` returns 0/1 instead of calling `sys.exit()`. Tests use this to avoid catching `SystemExit`.
- Route all CLI I/O through provided streams; avoid writing to `sys.__stdout__`.
- Error message consistency: wrap invalid base64 during text decryption into `CryptoError("Text decryption failed")`.
- Tidy: removed unused helper and imports in `src/secure_string_cipher/cli.py`. Enabled previously skipped CLI tests.
