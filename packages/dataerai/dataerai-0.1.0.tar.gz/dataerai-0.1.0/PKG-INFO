# Description

Dataerai is a federated scientific data management system developed by Oak Ridge
National Laboratories to facilitate FAIR data practices within supported
experimental, compute, and analytics environments. The Dataerai Python package
provides both a command-line-interface (CLI) and a programming API for
interacting with Dataerai services.

# Developers

For running dataerai directly from the source folder located in the Dataerai
GitHub repository, without running a pip install of the package. Activate the
python env. This might be installed at /opt/dataerai/dependencies/python/bin if
you used Dataerai's provided dependency install scripts with the default
location.

```
source /opt/dataerai/dependencies/python/bin/activate
```

Run the following from the root of the Dataerai repo. The generate_dataerai 
script will generate default settings. the ENABLE_PYTHON_CLIENT is to make
sure you actually build the python client. Many other default flags may be
turned on, you can disable them if needed.

The build target will "pydataerai" is needed for compiling the protobuf files
to python, you will need protobuf to be installed.

NOTE - You will need to rerun this command any times changes are made to the
.proto files.

```
./scripts/generate_dataerai.sh
/opt/dataerai/dependencies/bin/cmake -S. -B build -DENABLE_PYTHON_CLIENT=ON
/opt/dataerai/dependencies/bin/cmake --build build --target pydataerai
```

Move into the python/dataerai_pkg folder and then you can execute the python
cli tool directly with.

```
PYTHON_PATH=. ./scripts/dataerai
```
