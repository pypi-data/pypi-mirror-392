# pybubble

A simple wrapper around `bwrap` to create sandbox environments for executing code. It works without Docker or other daemon-based container runtimes, using shared read-only root filesystems for quick (1-2ms) setup times.

While these environments are sandboxed and provide protection from accidental modification of your host system by overzealous LLMs, **pybubble is not an acceptable substitute for virtualization when running untrusted code**. If you are giving untrusted people access to this, either directly or via an LLM frontend, consider using more production-ready sandboxing or virtualization tools with pybubble just isolating environment state.

Feel free to submit bug reports and pull requests via GitHub, but note that Arcee is not committing to long-term maintenence of this software. This is just a small library I built in my spare time and thought everyone else would find useful.

Due to relying on Linux kernel features to operate, pybubble is not compatible with macOS or Windows.

## Setup

Install `bwrap`. On Ubuntu, do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap
```

Then, add `pybubble` to your project.

```bash
uv add pybubble
```

## Root filesystem archives

If all you need is basic Python code execution, consider using the provided root filesystem archive under our GitHub release. It comes preinstalled with:

- Python
- uv
- bash
- ripgrep
- cURL & wget
- numpy
- pandas
- httpx & requests
- pillow
- ImageMagick

If you need more tools or want to run a leaner environment, follow [this guide](docs/build-rootfs.md) to build one yourself.

## Run code

Create a sandbox by doing:

```python
from pybubble import Sandbox
import asyncio

async def main():
    s = Sandbox("path/to/rootfs.tgz")

    stdout, stderr = await s.run("ping -c 1 google.com", allow_network=True)

    print(stdout.decode("utf-8")) # ping output

    stdout, stderr = await s.run_python("print('hello, world')", timeout=5.0)

    print(stdout.decode("utf-8")) # "hello, world"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
