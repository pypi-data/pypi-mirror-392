def set_log_callback(callback: Optional[Callable[[str], None]]) -> None:
    """
    Set optional logging callback.

    Args:
        callback: A callable that takes a string message, or None to disable logging.
                  The callback will be invoked whenever a memory barrier function is called,
                  with information about which implementation is being used.

    Example:
        >>> import membar
        >>> membar.set_log_callback(print)
        >>> membar.wmb()                        # will log which implementation is used
        >>> membar.set_log_callback(None)       # disable logging

    Or use a custom logger:
        >>> import logging
        >>> logger = logging.getLogger("membar_logger")
        >>> membar.set_log_callback(logger.info)  # Use logger.info (can also use .debug, .warning, etc.)
        >>> membar.rmb()                                # logs via the logger
        >>> membar.set_log_callback(None)               # disable logging
