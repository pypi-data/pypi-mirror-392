# V2Sim Family

> Open-Source V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network

**Documents:** https://hesl-seu.github.io/v2sim-wiki

V2Sim family includes several open-source software for coupled urban power and transportation network. They are different in the transportation simulation part.

+ **V2Sim**: Use SUMO for **MICROSCOPIC** traffic simulation. It could identify the microscopic motion of a single vehicle, including its lane, speed, accerlation, etc. This version is suitable if your research concerns the implication of delicate motion of EVs on power grid. (Link: [V2Sim](https://github.com/hesl-seu/v2sim/))

+ **V2Sim-UX**: Use UXsim for **MESOCOPIC** traffic simulation. It runs much faster than the microscopic version, and can be accelerated furthermore with free-threading Python (3.14+). This version is suitable if your research need fast iterations and focus on the overall implication of the traffic flow. (Please scroll down to read instructions.)

## V2Sim-UX: The Mesoscopic Version

V2Sim-UX is a mesoscopic V2G simulation platform in urban power and transportation network. It is open-source under BSD license. The traffic simulation is based on [UXsim](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim).

## Quick start
This package has been uploaded to PyPI. It can be installed by:
```
pip install v2simux
```

Then, input the following command to open the GUI:
```
v2simux-gui
```
