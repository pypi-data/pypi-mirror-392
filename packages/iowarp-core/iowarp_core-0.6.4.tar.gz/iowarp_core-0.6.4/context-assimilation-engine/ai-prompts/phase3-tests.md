Let's begin implementing some unit tests. Use unit test agent.

In this case, the only API worth testing extensively is ParseOmni.

The test cases for us should be bash scripts.

Let's put them under chimods/test/unit.

## General wrp config for tests

Up to 16GB DRAM.

```yaml
# Content Transfer Engine (CTE) Configuration File
# RAM-only storage configuration for benchmark testing

# Target management settings
targets:
  neighborhood: 1  # Single-node configuration
  default_target_timeout_ms: 30000
  poll_period_ms: 5000  # Period to rescan targets for statistics (capacity, bandwidth, etc.)

# Storage block device configuration
# RAM-only configuration for benchmark testing
storage:
  # Primary RAM storage
  - path: "ram::cte_ram_tier1"
    bdev_type: "ram"
    capacity_limit: "16GB"
    score: 0.0           # Manual score override (0.0-1.0) - highest tier

# Data Placement Engine configuration
dpe:
  dpe_type: "max_bw"  # Options: "random", "round_robin", "max_bw"

# Note: This configuration uses only RAM-based storage for maximum performance
# benchmarking. All data is stored in memory with no persistent storage.
```

## Binary Assimilation Test

Create a C++ file, which optionally initializes the chimaera runtime (set through an environment variable), connects to the CTE using WRP_CTE_CLIENT_INIT, and then creates a custom pool for the CAE. We should update the code to use a constant for this PoolId consistently. Lets' use 400, 0. Place the test under test/unit/binary_assim

First, the test must generate a file. Let's say 256MB. The file should be in gitignore and should be deleted after the test.

The test will call ParseOmni using an omni file that will be generated and stored specifically for this test. The omni should not be generated by the C++ code, and should be placed binary_assim_omni.yaml

### Omni file

src will be a file in the filesystem.
dst will be iowarp::example
depends_on empty
