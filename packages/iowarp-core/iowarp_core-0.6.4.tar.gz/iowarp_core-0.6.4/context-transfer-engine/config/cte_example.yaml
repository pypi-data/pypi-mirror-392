# Content Transfer Engine (CTE) Configuration File
# This file defines the configuration for the CTE core module

# Target management settings
targets:
  neighborhood: 4  # Number of nodes for horizontal buffering
  default_target_timeout_ms: 30000
  poll_period_ms: 5000  # Period to rescan targets for statistics (capacity, bandwidth, etc.)

# Storage block device configuration
storage:
  # High-performance NVMe storage for primary data
