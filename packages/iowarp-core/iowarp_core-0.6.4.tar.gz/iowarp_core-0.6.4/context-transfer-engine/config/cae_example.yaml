# WRP Content Adapter Engine (CAE) Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines which paths should be tracked by the
# CTE adapters using include/exclude regex patterns.

# Include patterns - regex patterns for paths to intercept
# Patterns are checked in order of specificity (longest first)
# If a path matches an include pattern, it will be intercepted
# Environment variables are expanded using hshm::ConfigParse::ExpandPath
include:
  - ".*test_hermes.*"     # Default: test directories
  - "$HOME/data.*"        # Home directory data (env var expanded)
  - "/scratch.*"          # Scratch space and subdirectories
  - "/mnt/shared.*"       # Shared mount points

# Exclude patterns - regex patterns for paths to NOT intercept
# These take precedence based on specificity (path length)
# If a path matches an exclude pattern, it will NOT be intercepted
# Environment variables are also expanded in exclude patterns
exclude:
  - "/tmp.*"              # Exclude temporary files
  - "$HOME/data/exclude.*"  # Exclude specific subdirectories (env var expanded)
  - "/scratch/private.*"  # Exclude private scratch areas

# Path matching behavior:
# 1. Patterns are sorted by length (descending) for specificity
# 2. Most specific pattern is checked first
# 3. First matching pattern determines result (include or exclude)
# 4. If no patterns match, path is excluded by default

# Adapter page size in bytes
# This controls the granularity of I/O operations in the adapters
# Common values: 4096, 8192, 16384, 65536, 1048576
adapter_page_size: 1048576  # 1MB

# Global interception enable/disable (optional, defaults to true)
# When false, all interception is disabled regardless of path patterns
interception_enabled: true
