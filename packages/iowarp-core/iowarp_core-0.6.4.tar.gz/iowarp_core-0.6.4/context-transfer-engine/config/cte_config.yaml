# Content Transfer Engine (CTE) Configuration File
# Docker deployment configuration for single-node setup

# Target management settings
targets:
  neighborhood: 1  # Single-node configuration
  default_target_timeout_ms: 30000
  poll_period_ms: 5000  # Period to rescan targets for statistics (capacity, bandwidth, etc.)

# Storage block device configuration
# For Docker deployment, we use simple file-based storage
storage:
  # Primary storage device
  - path: "/mnt/cte_storage/storage1.bin"
    bdev_type: "file"
    capacity_limit: "1GB"
    score: 0.9           # Manual score override (0.0-1.0) - highest tier

  # RAM-based cache storage (use ram:: prefix)
  - path: "ram::cte_cache"
    bdev_type: "ram"
    capacity_limit: "512MB"
    score: 1.0           # Manual score override - fastest tier

  # Secondary storage device
  - path: "/mnt/cte_storage/storage2.bin"
    bdev_type: "file"
    capacity_limit: "1GB"
    score: 0.7           # Manual score override - medium tier

# Data Placement Engine configuration
dpe:
  dpe_type: "max_bw"  # Options: "random", "round_robin", "max_bw"

# Note: This configuration is suitable for Docker single-node deployment
# For multi-node or production deployments, adjust:
# - neighborhood: increase for distributed buffering
# - storage: add more devices or increase capacity limits
# - paths: ensure storage paths are accessible from all nodes
