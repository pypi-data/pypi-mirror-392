# Example hostfile for Chimaera runtime
# This file contains host patterns that the runtime will attempt to bind to
# in order to identify which host the process is running on

# Simple hostnames
localhost
127.0.0.1

# Range patterns (compute01-ib, compute02-ib, ..., compute64-ib)
# compute[01-64]-ib

# More range patterns
# node[001-128]
# gpu[01-16]-ib

# You can also specify individual hosts
# headnode
# storage01
# storage02
