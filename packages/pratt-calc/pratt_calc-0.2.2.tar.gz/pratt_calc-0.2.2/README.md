# Introduction

An arithmetic expression calculator in Python, demoing the Pratt
parsing algorithm.

This takes inspiration from [this 2010 blog
post](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/01/02/top-down-operator-precedence-parsing)
by Eli Bendersky, as well as a few other sources:

# Requirements

Requires Python 3.13 or greater.

# Installation

`pipx install pratt-calc`

In some cases it may be necessary to specify the Python version
manually:

`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=python3.13 pipx install pratt-calc`

Or, if you have `uv` installed:

`uvx pipx install pratt-calc`

# Contributing

Install `uv`, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrandonIrizarry/pratt-calc
cd pratt-calc
uv sync --locked
```

# Usage

`pratt-calc $EXPRESSION`

Example: 

`pratt-calc '3-4*5'`

This should print `-17` at the console.

Note that surrounding the input with single-quotes is recommended for
all but the simplest expressions, to avoid clashing with the shell
you're using.

# Trigonometric Functions

`pratt-calc` supports the following trigonometric functions:

1. sin
2. cos
3. tan
4. csc
5. sec
6. cot

The constant 𝝿 is also available as `pi`. Examples:

`pratt-calc 'cos(pi)'` => `-1.0`

`pratt-calc 'sin(1)^2 + cos(1)^2'` => `1.0`

## A Note on the Implementation of Trig Functions

Trig functions are implemented as unary operators, as opposed to
function calls. Hence the parentheses used by `sin` and so forth are
merely there to enforce precedence, even though they conveniently
evoke the intuition of a function call.
