          I noticed a small typo in that famous pangram! It should be:

          "The quick brown fox jumps over the **lazy dog**."

          (There should be a space between "lazy" and "dog")

          This sentence is often used for testing typewriters, fonts, and keyboards because it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.
