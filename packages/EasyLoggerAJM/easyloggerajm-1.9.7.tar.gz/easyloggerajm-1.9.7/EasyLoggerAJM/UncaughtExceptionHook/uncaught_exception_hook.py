class UncaughtExceptionHook:
    """
    Class to handle uncaught exceptions in a Python application,
    log them to a file, send email notifications, and exit the application gracefully.

    Class Components:
    1. Initialization:
       - Initializes an instance of `UncaughtLogger`.
       - Prepares a logger with an email handler for administrator notification.
       - Defines the log file path for unhandled exceptions.

    2. Methods:
       - `_basic_log_to_file(exc_type, exc_value, tb)`:
           Logs the details of the uncaught exception into a specified file.
           Ensures the existing log file is removed if already present to avoid conflicts.
           Handles any errors during logging gracefully.

       - `show_exception_and_exit(exc_type, exc_value, tb)`:
           Handles the uncaught exception by:
           a. Logging the exception details using `_basic_log_to_file`.
           b. Calling the default exception hook to print the traceback information to the console.
           c. Logging the exception using the uncaught logger.
           d. Initializing a new email notification via the associated emailer.
           e. Displaying a console message to inform where the exception logs are stored.
           f. Prompting the user to press enter to exit the program.
           g. Exiting the application with a status code of -1.

    Use example:
        in __init__.py:
        ueh = UncaughtExceptionHook()

        sys.excepthook = ueh.show_exception_and_exit
