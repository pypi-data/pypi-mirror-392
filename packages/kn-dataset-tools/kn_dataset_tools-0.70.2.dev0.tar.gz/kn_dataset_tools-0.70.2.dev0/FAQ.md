```css
/* YOUR THEME NAME */
QMainWindow { 
    background-color: #your-main-color; 
    color: #your-text-color;
}

QPushButton { 
    background-color: #button-color;
    border: 1px solid #border-color;
    border-radius: 4px;
    padding: 8px;
}

QPushButton:hover {
    background-color: #hover-color;
}

QTextEdit, QPlainTextEdit {

### Why isn't my theme applying correctly?

**Common Theme Issues:**

1. **File Location:** Ensure `.qss` file is in `dataset_tools/themes/`
2. **File Extension:** Must be `.qss` (not `.css`)
3. **Syntax Errors:** Use Qt StyleSheet syntax, not regular CSS
4. **Restart Required:** Restart application to detect new themes
5. **Case Sensitivity:** Theme names are case-sensitive on some systems

**Debugging Tips:**
- Check console output for theme loading errors
- Start with a simple theme and add complexity gradually
- Use existing themes as reference for proper syntax

### How do fonts interact with themes?

**Font-Theme Compatibility:**
- ✅ **Fonts work with ALL themes** - they're applied globally
- ✅ **Theme switching preserves** your selected font
- ✅ **Custom fonts override** theme font specifications
- ⚠️ **Some themes specify** font families (like Terminal Hacker using monospace)

**Best Practices:**
- **Choose readable fonts** that work well at different sizes
- **Test font-theme combinations** before settling on your setup
- **Consider theme aesthetics** - serif fonts work well with classical themes, sans-serif with modern ones

## 📋 Log Files & Debugging Support

### Where are the log files created?

Dataset Tools **automatically creates detailed log files** every time you run the application:

- **📁 Location:** `logs/` directory (created in the same folder where you run Dataset Tools)
- **📄 File Name:** `dataset_tools_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` (timestamped for each session)
- **🔄 Fresh File:** New log file created every time you start the application
- **📝 Content:** Everything that happens during your session

**Example log file:** `dataset_tools_20250112_143015.log`

### What's included in the log files?

**Complete Application Activity:**
- ✅ Dataset Tools startup and shutdown
- ✅ File loading and metadata parsing  
- ✅ Theme changes and UI operations
- ✅ Error messages with full details
- ✅ PyQt6 (GUI framework) messages
- ✅ PIL/Pillow (image processing) activities
- ✅ External library interactions

**Sample log entry:**
```
2025-01-12 14:30:15 | INFO     | dataset_tools_app | main:140 | Dataset Tools v1.0.0 launching...
2025-01-12 14:30:16 | ERROR    | PyQt6 | widget_creation:45 | Widget failed to load: Invalid theme
2025-01-12 14:30:17 | DEBUG    | PIL | image_loader:123 | Loading image: /path/to/your/image.png
```

### How do I find my log file for bug reports?

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Navigate** to the folder where you run Dataset Tools
2. **Look for** the `logs/` subdirectory 
3. **Find** the most recent file (newest timestamp)
4. **Attach** this file to your GitHub issue or support request

**Quick Tips:**
- 🕒 **Most Recent:** Files are timestamped - grab the newest one
- 💾 **File Size:** Log files are small (usually under 1MB) and safe to share
- 🔒 **Privacy:** Logs contain file paths but no file contents or personal data
- 📧 **Sharing:** Safe to attach to GitHub issues or email for support

### What if I can't find the logs directory?

**Troubleshooting Log Location:**
- **Default Location:** Same directory where you run `dataset-tools` command
- **Windows:** Usually in your user directory or where you opened Command Prompt
- **macOS/Linux:** Usually in your home directory or current terminal location
- **Alternative:** Run Dataset Tools with `--log-level DEBUG` to see more verbose output

**Still Can't Find Logs?**
1. Run Dataset Tools from a known location (like your Desktop)
2. The `logs/` folder will be created there
3. Or check the application startup messages - the log file path is displayed

### How do log levels affect what's recorded?

**Log Levels (use `--log-level LEVEL`):**
- **DEBUG:** Everything (most verbose) - best for troubleshooting
- **INFO:** Normal operations and important events (default)
- **WARNING:** Potential issues and important notices
- **ERROR:** Only errors and critical problems

**For Bug Reports:** Use `--log-level DEBUG` to get the most detailed information.

**Example:**
```bash
# Run with maximum logging detail
dataset-tools --log-level DEBUG
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError" when starting

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall with all dependencies
pip install --force-reinstall kn-dataset-tools

# Or install missing module specifically
pip install [missing-module-name]
```

### Application crashes on startup

1. **Check Python version:** `python --version` (must be 3.10+)
2. **Try safe mode:** Start with minimal theme
3. **Clear settings:** Delete config files in `~/.config/DatasetViewer/`
4. **Check logs:** Look in the `logs/` directory for error details

### Fonts look wrong or missing

**Windows:**
```bash
# Install with font support
pip install kn-dataset-tools[fonts]
```

**macOS/Linux:**
- Install system fonts: `sudo apt install fonts-liberation` (Ubuntu)
- Restart the application after font installation

### Images won't load or display incorrectly

1. **Check file permissions:** Ensure files are readable
2. **Verify image format:** Use common formats (PNG, JPEG)
3. **Memory issues:** Try with smaller images first
4. **Missing codecs:** Install additional image libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow[all]
   ```

### ComfyUI metadata not showing

1. **Verify format:** Ensure it's a valid ComfyUI workflow JSON
2. **Check file size:** Very large workflows may take time to parse
3. **Validate JSON:** Use a JSON validator to check file structure

### "Well, you said it worked on your machine!"

Sometimes, a feature may work in a development environment but not in the packaged application. This can happen because the lead developer, Duskfallcrew, often works in "editable mode" (`pip install -e .`), which can cause minor discrepancies in how files and dependencies are handled compared to a standard installation.

If you encounter an issue that seems to stem from this, please know that it is not your fault. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention so we can resolve it for all users. Please open a bug report on our GitHub repository, and we will address it as quickly as possible.
