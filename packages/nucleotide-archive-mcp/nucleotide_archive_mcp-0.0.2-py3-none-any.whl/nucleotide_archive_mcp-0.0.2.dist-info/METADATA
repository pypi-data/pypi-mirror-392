           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
           of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][],
in particular, the [API documentation][].

You can also find the project on [BioContextAI](https://biocontext.ai), the community-hub for biomedical MCP servers: [nucleotide_archive_mcp on BioContextAI](https://biocontext.ai/registry/biocontext-ai/nucleotide_archive_mcp).

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.11 or newer installed on your system.
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend installing [uv][].

There are several alternative options to install nucleotide_archive_mcp:

### 1. Use `uvx` to run it immediately
After publication to PyPI:
```bash
uvx nucleotide_archive_mcp
```

Or from a Git repository:

```bash
uvx git+https://github.com/biocontext-ai/nucleotide_archive_mcp.git@main
```

### 2. Include it in one of various clients that supports the `mcp.json` standard

If your MCP server is published to PyPI, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleotide_archive_mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["nucleotide_archive_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
In case the MCP server is not yet published to PyPI, use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleotide_archive_mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["git+https://github.com/biocontext-ai/nucleotide_archive_mcp.git@main"]
    }
  }
}
```

For purely local development (e.g., in Cursor or VS Code), use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleotide_archive_mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--refresh",
        "--from",
        "path/to/repository",
        "nucleotide_archive_mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to reuse and existing environment for local development, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nucleotide_archive_mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "path/to/repository", "nucleotide_archive_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Install it through `pip`:

```bash
pip install --user nucleotide_archive_mcp
```

### 4. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/biocontext-ai/nucleotide_archive_mcp.git@main
```

## Configuration

The server can be configured via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize:

```bash
# ENA API Configuration
ENA_PORTAL_API_BASE=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/portal/api  # Override API base URL
ENA_BROWSER_API_BASE=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api
ENA_TIMEOUT=30.0                # Request timeout in seconds
ENA_SEARCH_LIMIT=20            # Default search result limit
ENA_MAX_RPS=10.0               # Rate limiting (requests per second)

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

These settings allow you to:
- Use custom or mirror ENA API endpoints
- Adjust timeouts for slow connections
- Control default result limits
- Configure rate limiting for large batch operations
- Set logging verbosity for debugging
