`py_wlcommands` is a command-line toolset based on Python that provides automated command support for project development, covering common development tasks such as environment initialization, building, testing, formatting, cleaning, and code checking. The project combines Python and Rust technology stacks, demonstrating attention to performance and scalability.

## Features

- **init**: Initialize project environment with Git, virtual environment, i18n, Rust submodule, etc.
- **build**: Execute build tasks, support Python package building and distribution
- **test**: Run project tests
- **format**: Support Python and Rust code formatting (integrated with black, rustfmt, etc.)
- **lint**: Execute code quality checks
- **clean**: Clean build artifacts and temporary files
- **self**: Self-management commands

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install py-wlcommands
```

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wl-commands/py_wlcommands.git
cd py_wlcommands

```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the `wl` command:

```bash
# Show help
wl --help

# Initialize a new project
wl init

# Build the project
wl build
