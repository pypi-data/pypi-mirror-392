## 2. Features

- **Simulated Annealing**: Temperature-based acceptance of suboptimal solutions to escape local minima
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple replicates simultaneously for diverse solutions
- **Flexible Objectives**: Support for any objective function with multiple metrics
- **Multi-Column Support**: Optimize datasets with any number of features/columns
- **Checkpoint/Resume**: Save and resume long-running optimizations
- **Boundary Handling**: Reflection-based strategy prevents point accumulation at boundaries
- **Visualization**: Built-in plotting for both input data and optimization results
- **JIT Compilation**: Numba-optimized core functions for performance

## 3. Quick Start

### 3.1. Installation

Install the package directly from PyPI to use it in your own projects:

```bash
pip install parallel-hill-climber
```

For detailed usage, configuration options, and advanced features, see the <a href="https://gperdrizet.github.io/hill_climber" target="_blank">full documentation</a>.

### 3.2. Example climb

Simple hill climb to maximize the Pearson correlation coefficient between two random uniform features:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from hill_climber import HillClimber

# Create sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.random.rand(100),
    'y': np.random.rand(100)
})

# Define objective function
def my_objective(x, y):
    correlation = pd.Series(x).corr(pd.Series(y))
    metrics = {'correlation': correlation}
    return metrics, correlation

# Create optimizer
climber = HillClimber(
    data=data,
    objective_func=my_objective,
    max_time=1,  # minutes
    mode='maximize'
)

# Run optimization with multiple replicates
results = climber.climb_parallel(replicates=4, initial_noise=0.1)

# Visualize results
climber.plot_results(results, plot_type='histogram')
```
