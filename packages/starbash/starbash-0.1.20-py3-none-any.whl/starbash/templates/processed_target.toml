# this section contains textual information the user might want to share on social media or whatever
# some of it comes from FITS headers gleaned during processing or other statistics

# The creator of this image session
# (if not present this section will be auto generated at processing time)
# this whole secion is auto copied from userprefs.sb.toml
# The format of this session is compatible with the Citation File Format (CFF)
# see https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md
# for details.
# The only difference is to facilitate toml parsing we use an = sign instead of :
# if/when .cff file exports are required we'll do that conversion then.

[processing.recipe]

# if specified a specific recipe will be used, otherwiase one will be chosen and run
# automatically
# Starbash will search all recipe repos to find this by name
# url = "http://foo.blah/osc-dual-duo"

# other standard recipes...
# osc-duo, osc-broadband
# mono-sho (fixme find other names used in mono workflow land)

# a default starbash file for a particular processed target will typically contain only the preceeding

[processing.recipe.options]

# elegible recipes available for use, if one was not specified above the first recipe in this list will be used
