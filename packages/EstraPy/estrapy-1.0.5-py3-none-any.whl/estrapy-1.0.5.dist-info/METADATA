# EstraPy

EstraPy is a synchrotron analysis tool, built in Python 3.
It uses input files, written in a simple to read syntax, to perform analysis of synchrotron data files. The program supports the import, main data handling, plotting and output data. The documentation is available [here](https://ramsteak.github.io/EstraPy/).
EstraPy is run by the command line, and executes the commands one by one.
