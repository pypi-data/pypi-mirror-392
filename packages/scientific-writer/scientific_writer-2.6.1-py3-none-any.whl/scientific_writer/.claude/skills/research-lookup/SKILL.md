## Parallel Research Workflow

This skill now includes an **automated research workflow** that dramatically speeds up research for multiple topics:

### Complete Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Research Topics**
```python
research = ResearchLookup()

# Analyze text to identify research questions
with open("research_proposal.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()

topics = research.identify_research_topics(
    text=text,
    output_file="research_topics.txt"  # Save for review
)
# Identifies: ["Recent CRISPR applications in cancer", "mRNA vaccine mechanisms", ...]
```

**Step 2: Review and Edit Topics** (Optional)
- Open `research_topics.txt`
- Review, edit, add, or remove topics
- Each line is a separate research query

**Step 3: Execute Parallel Research**
```python
# Load topics from file and research in parallel
topics = research.load_topics_from_file("research_topics.txt")

results = research.parallel_lookup(
    queries=topics,
    max_workers=10  # Run 10 queries simultaneously
)

# Or use batch_lookup with parallel flag
results = research.batch_lookup(
    queries=topics,
    parallel=True,
    max_workers=10
)
```

**Complete Workflow in One Call**
```python
# Do everything in one step
result = research.identify_and_research(
    text=text,
    topics_file="research_topics.txt",
    parallel=True,
    max_workers=10,
    output_file="research_results.json"
)
```

### Command-Line Usage

**Identify Topics from Text**
```bash
# Identify research topics and save to file
python research_lookup.py --identify input.txt --topics-file topics.txt

# Review and edit topics.txt as needed
```

**Run Parallel Research**
```bash
# Research all topics in parallel (much faster!)
python research_lookup.py --topics-file topics.txt --parallel --max-workers 10

# Save results to JSON
python research_lookup.py --topics-file topics.txt --parallel --output results.json
```

**Complete Workflow**
```bash
# Identify topics and immediately research them in parallel
python research_lookup.py --identify input.txt --topics-file topics.txt --parallel --max-workers 10 --output results.json
```

### Performance Benefits

**Sequential vs Parallel Execution**

| Queries | Sequential (5 queries/min) | Parallel (10 workers) | Time Saved |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| 5       | ~1 minute                  | ~15 seconds          | 75%       |
| 10      | ~2 minutes                 | ~20 seconds          | 83%       |
| 20      | ~4 minutes                 | ~30 seconds          | 87%       |
| 50      | ~10 minutes                | ~1 minute            | 90%       |

**Best Practices for Parallel Execution**:
- Use `max_workers=5-10` for optimal performance
- Higher worker counts may hit API rate limits
- Topics are researched simultaneously, results maintain original order
- Failed queries don't block successful ones

### Topic Identification

The skill uses AI to automatically identify research topics from:
- Research proposals and hypotheses
- Literature review outlines
- Discussion sections needing citations
- Methods sections needing protocol references
- Grant applications
- Manuscript drafts

**Example Input:**
```
We propose to investigate CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects in human cells.
Background research is needed on current detection methods and mitigation
strategies. We also need to understand the regulatory landscape for gene
editing therapies in the US and EU.
```

**Identified Topics:**
```
1. CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects in human cells
2. Methods for detecting CRISPR off-target mutations
3. Strategies to mitigate CRISPR off-target effects
4. Regulatory requirements for gene editing therapies in United States
5. European Union regulations for gene editing clinical trials
```

## Automatic Model Selection

This skill features **intelligent model selection** based on query complexity:

### Model Types

**1. Sonar Pro** (`perplexity/sonar-pro`)
- **Use Case**: Straightforward information lookup
- **Best For**: 
  - Simple fact-finding queries
  - Recent publication searches
  - Basic protocol lookups
  - Statistical data retrieval
- **Speed**: Fast responses
- **Cost**: Lower cost per query

**2. Sonar Reasoning Pro** (`perplexity/sonar-reasoning-pro`)
- **Use Case**: Complex analytical queries requiring deep reasoning
- **Best For**:
  - Comparative analysis ("compare X vs Y")
  - Synthesis of multiple studies
  - Evaluating trade-offs or controversies
  - Explaining mechanisms or relationships
  - Critical analysis and interpretation
- **Speed**: Slower but more thorough
- **Cost**: Higher cost per query, but provides deeper insights

### Complexity Assessment

The skill automatically detects query complexity using these indicators:

**Reasoning Keywords** (triggers Sonar Reasoning Pro):
- Analytical: `compare`, `contrast`, `analyze`, `analysis`, `evaluate`, `critique`
- Comparative: `versus`, `vs`, `vs.`, `compared to`, `differences between`, `similarities`
- Synthesis: `meta-analysis`, `systematic review`, `synthesis`, `integrate`
- Causal: `mechanism`, `why`, `how does`, `how do`, `explain`, `relationship`, `causal relationship`, `underlying mechanism`
- Theoretical: `theoretical framework`, `implications`, `interpret`, `reasoning`
- Debate: `controversy`, `conflicting`, `paradox`, `debate`, `reconcile`
- Trade-offs: `pros and cons`, `advantages and disadvantages`, `trade-off`, `tradeoff`, `trade offs`
- Complexity: `multifaceted`, `complex interaction`, `critical analysis`

**Complexity Scoring**:
- Reasoning keywords: 3 points each (heavily weighted)
- Multiple questions: 2 points per question mark
- Complex sentence structures: 1.5 points per clause indicator (and, or, but, however, whereas, although)
- Very long queries: 1 point if >150 characters
- **Threshold**: Queries scoring ≥3 points trigger Sonar Reasoning Pro

**Practical Result**: Even a single strong reasoning keyword (compare, explain, analyze, etc.) will trigger the more powerful Sonar Reasoning Pro model, ensuring you get deep analysis when needed.

**Example Query Classification**:

✅ **Sonar Pro** (straightforward lookup):
- "Recent advances in CRISPR gene editing 2024"
- "Prevalence of diabetes in US population"
- "Western blot protocol for protein detection"

✅ **Sonar Reasoning Pro** (complex analysis):
- "Compare and contrast mRNA vaccines vs traditional vaccines for cancer treatment"
- "Explain the mechanism underlying the relationship between gut microbiome and depression"
- "Analyze the controversy surrounding AI in medical diagnosis and evaluate trade-offs"

### Manual Override

You can force a specific model using the `force_model` parameter:

```python
# Force Sonar Pro for fast lookup
research = ResearchLookup(force_model='pro')

# Force Sonar Reasoning Pro for deep analysis
research = ResearchLookup(force_model='reasoning')

# Automatic selection (default)
research = ResearchLookup()
```

Command-line usage:
```bash
# Force Sonar Pro
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-model pro

# Force Sonar Reasoning Pro
python research_lookup.py "your query" --force-model reasoning

# Automatic (no flag)
python research_lookup.py "your query"
```

- Standard protocols or methodologies
- Citation finding for specific papers
- Factual information retrieval

**For Complex Analysis (Sonar Reasoning Pro)**:
- Comparative studies and synthesis
- Mechanism explanations
- Controversy evaluation
- Trade-off analysis
- Theoretical frameworks
- Multi-faceted relationships

**Pro Tip**: The automatic selection is optimized for most use cases. Only use `force_model` if you have specific requirements or know the query needs deeper reasoning than detected.

### 2. Specific and Focused Queries

**Good Queries** (will trigger appropriate model):
- "Randomized controlled trials of mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment 2023-2024" → Sonar Pro
- "Compare the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines vs traditional vaccines for cancer treatment" → Sonar Reasoning Pro
- "Explain the mechanism by which CRISPR off-target effects occur and strategies to minimize them" → Sonar Reasoning Pro

**Poor Queries**:
- "Tell me about AI" (too broad)
- "Cancer research" (lacks specificity)
- "Latest news" (too vague)

### 3. Structured Query Format

**Recommended Structure**:
```
[Topic] + [Specific Aspect] + [Time Frame] + [Type of Information]
```

**Examples**:
- "CRISPR gene editing + off-target effects + 2024 + clinical trials"
- "Quantum computing + error correction + recent advances + review papers"
- "Renewable energy + solar efficiency + 2023-2024 + statistical data"

### 4. Follow-up Queries

**Effective Follow-ups**:
- "Show me the full citation for the Smith et al. 2024 paper"
- "What are the limitations of this methodology?"
- "Find similar studies using different approaches"
- "What controversies exist in this research area?"

## Integration with Scientific Writing
