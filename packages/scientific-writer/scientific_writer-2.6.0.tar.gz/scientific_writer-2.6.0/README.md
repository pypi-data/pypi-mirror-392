A Python package and CLI for generating publication-ready scientific papers, reports, posters, grant proposals, and more academic documents with Claude Sonnet 4.5. Features real-time research lookup, intelligent paper detection, and comprehensive document conversion. Version 2.0 adds a fully typed, programmatic API while keeping the CLI 100% backward compatible.

**✨ What's New in v2.4.0**
- **Smart File Routing** - Automatic categorization of manuscript, source, data, and image files
- **Enhanced Editing Mode** - .tex files automatically routed to drafts/ for seamless editing
- **Sources Folder** - Separate folder for reference materials (.md, .docx, .pdf) to keep context organized
- **Improved File Processing** - Better error handling and user feedback during file operations
- **Streamlined Workflow** - Clearer distinction between editable manuscripts and reference materials

**✨ Previous Features (v2.0+)**
- Programmatic Python API with async support
- Research lookup with Perplexity Sonar Pro
- Intelligent paper detection (auto-resume editing)
- Clinical reports (case reports, diagnostic reports, trial reports, HIPAA compliance)
- Grant proposal generation (NSF, NIH, DOE, DARPA)
- Research posters with LaTeX
- Scientific schematics (CONSORT, circuits, pathways)
- Document conversion (15+ formats with MarkItDown)
- ScholarEval peer review framework

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.12
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required), OPENROUTER_API_KEY (optional for research lookup)

### Install

#### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)
```bash
pip install scientific-writer
```

#### Option 2: Install from source with uv
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-scientific-writer.git
cd claude-scientific-writer
uv sync
```

### Configure API keys
```bash
# .env file (recommended)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key" > .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key" >> .env
# or export in your shell
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your_key'
```

### Use the CLI
```bash
# If installed via pip
scientific-writer

# If installed from source with uv
uv run scientific-writer
```

### Use the Python API
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():
    async for update in generate_paper("Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing"):
        if update["type"] == "progress":
            print(f"[{update['percentage']}%] {update['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"PDF: {update['files']['pdf_final']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Use as a Claude Code Plugin

This repository can be used as a Claude Code (Cursor) plugin to provide scientific writing skills and templates directly in your IDE.

#### Installation

1. **Install the plugin** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   # In Claude Code, run:
   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-writer
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer
   ```

2. **Initialize in your project**:
   ```bash
   # In any project directory:
   /scientific-writer:init
   ```
   This creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with scientific writing instructions and makes all skills available.

3. **Start using**:
   - Ask Claude to "Create a Nature paper on [topic]"
   - Use any of the 19+ available skills (research-lookup, peer-review, clinical-reports, etc.)
   - All capabilities work directly in your IDE

See the [Plugin Testing Guide](#plugin-testing-local-development) below for local development instructions.

## Features

### 📝 Document Generation
- **Scientific papers** with IMRaD structure (Nature, Science, NeurIPS, etc.)
- **Clinical reports** (case reports, diagnostic reports, trial reports, patient documentation)
- **Research posters** using LaTeX (beamerposter, tikzposter, baposter)
- **Grant proposals** (NSF, NIH, DOE, DARPA) with agency-specific formatting
- **Literature reviews** with systematic citation management
- **Scientific schematics** (CONSORT diagrams, circuit diagrams, biological pathways)

### 🤖 AI-Powered Capabilities
- **Real-time research lookup** using Perplexity Sonar Pro (via OpenRouter)
- **Intelligent paper detection** - automatically identifies references to existing papers
- **Peer review feedback** with quantitative ScholarEval framework (8-dimension scoring)
- **Iterative editing** with context-aware revision suggestions

### 🔧 Developer-Friendly
- **Programmatic API** - Full async Python API with type hints
- **CLI interface** - Interactive command-line tool with progress tracking
- **Progress streaming** - Real-time updates during generation
- **Comprehensive results** - JSON output with metadata, file paths, citations

### 📦 Data & File Integration
- **Automatic data handling** - Drop files in `data/`, auto-sorted to `figures/` or `data/`
- **Document conversion** - PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX to Markdown with MarkItDown
- **Bibliography management** - Automatic BibTeX generation and citation formatting
- **Figure integration** - Images automatically referenced and organized

## Typical Workflow

### CLI Usage
1. Place figures and data in `data/` at the project root (images → `figures/`, files → `data/` automatically)
2. Run `scientific-writer` and describe what you want
3. Follow progress updates; outputs saved to `paper_outputs/<timestamp>_<topic>/`

```bash
# Start a new paper
> Create a Nature paper on CRISPR gene editing with 5 key references

# Continue editing (automatically detected)
> Add a methods section about the experimental setup

# Reference existing paper by topic
> Find the acoustics paper and add a conclusion section

# Generate a grant proposal
> Write an NSF proposal for quantum computing research

# Create a research poster
> Generate a conference poster from my paper
```

### API Usage
```python
import asyncio
from scientific_writer import generate_paper

async def main():
    async for update in generate_paper(
        query="Create a NeurIPS paper on transformers",
        data_files=["results.csv", "figure.png"],
        output_dir="./my_papers"
    ):
        if update["type"] == "progress":
            print(f"[{update['percentage']}%] {update['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"✓ PDF: {update['files']['pdf_final']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Plugin Testing (Local Development)

For developers working on the plugin or testing locally:

### Setup Local Marketplace

1. **Create a test marketplace** in the parent directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   mkdir -p test-marketplace/.claude-plugin
   ```

2. **Create marketplace configuration** (`test-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "test-marketplace",
     "owner": { "name": "K-Dense" },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "claude-scientific-writer",
         "source": "./claude-scientific-writer",
         "description": "Scientific writing skills and CLAUDE.md initializer"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Install and Test

3. **Add the test marketplace** in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add ./test-marketplace
   ```

4. **Install the plugin**:
   ```bash
   /plugin install claude-scientific-writer@test-marketplace
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Code** when prompted.

6. **Test the plugin**:
   - Open any project directory
   - Run `/scientific-writer:init`
   - Verify CLAUDE.md is created
   - Test skills: "What skills are available?"
   - Try creating a document: "Create a short scientific abstract on quantum computing"

### Troubleshooting Plugin Installation

- **Skills not showing**: Verify each `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
- **Command not working**: Check `commands/scientific-writer-init.md` exists and has proper frontmatter
- **Template not found**: Ensure `templates/CLAUDE.scientific-writer.md` is present
- **Marketplace not loading**: Verify `marketplace.json` syntax and relative path to plugin

## Migration (v1.x -> v2.0)
- CLI remains unchanged (scientific-writer).
- New programmatic API: from scientific_writer import generate_paper.
- Legacy single-file script is replaced by a proper package; no action needed for CLI users.
