## Introduction
------------

CImpact is a versatile Python library designed to empower analysts and data scientists to evaluate the causal impact of interventions on time series data. By integrating a suite of statistical and probabilistic models, CImpact offers robust and flexible tools for causal inference, ensuring adaptability across diverse use cases and modeling preferences.

With support for multiple cutting-edge frameworks, including TensorFlow Probability, Pyro, and Prophet, CImpact enables users to:

Quantify Intervention Effects: Measure the influence of interventions with confidence intervals and probabilistic predictions.
Leverage Advanced Models: Utilize models that capture trends, seasonality, and covariates, providing deeper insights into time series dynamics.
Customize Approaches: Select between Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Variational Inference (VI), or Prophet-based methods to match computational and analytical needs.
Seamlessly Handle Covariates: Account for external variables that impact the time series through regression components or regressors.

Whether your data exhibits complex seasonality, local trends, or requires the incorporation of contextual variables, CImpact equips you with a powerful toolkit to make informed decisions supported by rigorous statistical analysis.

## Why CImpact?
------------

CImpact extends the functionalities of the [tfcausalimpact](https://github.com/WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact) library by incorporating support for multiple modeling approaches. This modular design allows users to choose the best model for their specific needs and compare performance and results across different models. We highly recommend reading this detailed [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-causal-impact-on-top-of-tensorflow-probability-c837ea18b126) explainng the causal inference in great detail.

## Features
--------

- **Support for Advanced Models**  
  Leverage state-of-the-art statistical models for causal impact analysis, including:  
  - **TensorFlow Probability**: Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) models with support for trend, seasonality, and regression components.  
  - **Prophet**: Time series forecasting with robust handling of seasonality, missing data, and external regressors.  
  - **Pyro**: Bayesian regression using Variational Inference (VI) or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty quantification.  

- **Adapter-Based Modular Design**  
  Easily extend the library by integrating custom models. The adapter-based architecture allows seamless addition of new frameworks.  

- **Highly Configurable**  
  Fine-tune model parameters, specify covariates, and select fitting methods (e.g., HMC, VI) to tailor analyses to specific needs.  

- **Rigorous Evaluation**  
  Includes tools for pre- and post-intervention analysis, model performance assessment, and confidence interval computation for causal inference.  

- **Powerful Visualization**  
  Generate insightful visualizations, including forecasts, confidence intervals, and intervention effects, to better interpret and communicate results.  

## Use Cases & Examples
--------

CImpact is versatile and can be applied to various domains to measure the causal impact of interventions. Here are some examples:

- **Marketing Campaigns**: Assess the impact of a marketing campaign on sales over time using time series data.
- **Healthcare**: Evaluate the effect of a new drug or treatment on patient outcomes over a period.
- **Economic Policy**: Measure the impact of a new economic policy or regulatory change on key economic indicators.

# Define the configuration for the model

target_col = 'y'

# Define color variables (optional arguments)
observed_color = "#000000"         # Black for observed

ci = 95                            # Desired confidence interval

# Run the analysis
analysis = CausalImpactAnalysis(data, pre_period, post_period, model_config, index_col, target_col, observed_color,  predicted_color, ci_color, intervention_color, figsize, ci)

## Evaluation Methods
------------------

CImpact offers comprehensive tools to evaluate model performance and quantify the causal impact of interventions:  

- **Summary Statistics**  
  Obtain detailed point estimates, confidence intervals, and probabilistic measures of the intervention's impact.  

- **Impact Visualization**  
  Generate intuitive plots that display:  
  - Observed data versus counterfactual predictions.  
  - Estimated impact over time, including uncertainty intervals.  

- **Model Diagnostics**  
  Conduct residual analysis and access diagnostic metrics to evaluate model fit and robustness.  

## Performance Comparison
----------------------

CImpact supports a variety of models, each with unique strengths:  

- **TensorFlow**  
  Delivers robust performance with flexibility for advanced inference techniques, such as Variational Inference (VI) and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).  

- **Prophet**  
  Offers a user-friendly experience with built-in support for seasonality and holiday effects. While effective for many use cases, it may exhibit slower performance on larger datasets.  

- **Pyro**  
  Excels in Bayesian inference, enabling powerful probabilistic modeling. However, its computational demands can be higher compared to other models.  

## Model Comparison & Best Practices
----------------------

Each model in CImpact has unique advantages, and selecting the right model can significantly impact your results. Here are some recommendations for selecting a model based on your use case:

- **Prophet**: Best for time series data with clear seasonal patterns and holidays, and if interpretability and ease of use are a priority. However, it might struggle with very large datasets or complex causal relationships.
  
- **TensorFlow (Bayesian Structural Time Series)**: Ideal for users who need advanced Bayesian modeling and have computational resources for methods like HMC and VI. It works well for more complex time series data with multiple covariates and non-linearities.

- **Pyro**: Choose this model if you need a fully probabilistic approach for causal inference. It's perfect for those who need flexibility with custom priors and Bayesian inference but are comfortable with Pyro's steeper learning curve.

Make sure to benchmark each model using your data before committing to one, and consider running a few trials with different models to compare their performance.
