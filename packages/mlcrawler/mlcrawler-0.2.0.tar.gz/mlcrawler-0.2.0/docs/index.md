## What is mlcrawler?

mlcrawler helps you crawl websites in a polite and configurable manner. It supports:

- Sitemap discovery and parsing
- Seed URL crawling with optional link following
- Content extraction (main-article extraction using trafilatura or full-page extraction)
- HTML → Markdown conversion
- Disk caching and conditional GET handling
- Pluggable output (Markdown + metadata sidecars by default)

Whether you want to run it from the CLI or call it from Python code, this documentation will guide you through both workflows.
