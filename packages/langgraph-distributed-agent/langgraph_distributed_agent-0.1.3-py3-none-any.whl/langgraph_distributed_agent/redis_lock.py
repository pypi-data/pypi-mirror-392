    """
    A simple distributed lock implementation using Redis `SET NX EX`.

    This lock ensures that only one process can acquire the given key at a time.
    It uses a UUID as a lock value to verify ownership before releasing.

    Args:
        redis_client: An asynchronous Redis client instance supporting `set`, `get`, and `delete` methods.
        lock_key (str): The Redis key used for the lock.
        timeout (int): The lock expiration time in seconds. Default is 30.
        retry_interval (float): Interval in seconds between lock acquisition retries. Default is 0.1.

    Usage:
        async with redis_lock(redis_client, "my_lock_key"):
            # critical section
            ...

    Notes:
        - This lock is not reentrant.
        - The lock is automatically released when exiting the context if it is still held.
