# Map Games Proto: A Framework for Reinforcement Learning in Games

[![Original Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/forked%20from-OpenSpiel-blue)](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel)

**Map Games Proto** is a fork of OpenSpiel, maintained by LogitGames. This package is available on PyPI as `map-games-proto`.

OpenSpiel is a collection of environments and algorithms for research in general
reinforcement learning and search/planning in games. OpenSpiel supports n-player
(single- and multi- agent) zero-sum, cooperative and general-sum, one-shot and
sequential, strictly turn-taking and simultaneous-move, perfect and imperfect
information games, as well as traditional multiagent environments such as
(partially- and fully- observable) grid worlds and social dilemmas. OpenSpiel
also includes tools to analyze learning dynamics and other common evaluation
metrics. Games are represented as procedural extensive-form games, with some
natural extensions. The core API and games are implemented in C++ and exposed to
Python. Algorithms and tools are written both in C++ and Python.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install map-games-proto
```

Note: The package is installed as `map-games-proto` but imported as `open_spiel`:
```python
import open_spiel
```

## Original Repository

This is a fork of the original [OpenSpiel repository](https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel) by DeepMind.

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Next
- Make CC analogs of these classes:
class DeckStatus(PClass):
idx = field(type=int)
uuid = field(type=str)
faceup_stack = field(type=(FaceupCardStack, type(None)), initial=None)
faceup_spread = field(type=(FaceupCardSpread, type(None)), initial=None)
facedown_stack = field(type=(FacedownCardStack, type(None)), initial=None)
facedown_spread = field(type=(FacedownCardSpread, type(None)), initial=None)
discard_faceup_stack = field(type=(FaceupCardStack, type(None)), initial=None)
discard_facedown_stack = field(type=(FacedownCardStack, type(None)), initial=None)

## The command to run the tests is:

python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py

You can also run specific test methods if you want:

# Run just one test
python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py GamesInterstateTest.test_default_parameters

# Run with verbose output
python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py --verbose

If you want to run all Python tests in the test suite, you could do:

# Run all tests (if you have pytest installed)
pytest open_spiel/python/tests/

# Or run all game tests matching a pattern
python -m unittest discover open_spiel/python/tests/ "games_*_test.py"

The test uses absltest which is Google's testing framework, so it can be run directly as a Python script as shown above.

##  When you encounter a build error like "No rule to make target", follow these steps:

1. Try running make games directly from the build directory:
cd /Users/jh/Projects/map_games_proto/build
make games
1. This often resolves stale build state issues.
2. If that doesn't work, try a clean rebuild:
cd /Users/jh/Projects/map_games_proto/build
rm -rf games/CMakeFiles/games.dir/interstate/*
make games
3. For more serious issues, do a full clean and reconfigure:
cd /Users/jh/Projects/map_games_proto/build
rm -rf *
cmake ../open_spiel
make games
4. Use the build script from the project root:
cd /Users/jh/Projects/map_games_proto
./open_spiel/scripts/build_only.sh interstate


## Quick Rebuild and Test Commands:

Single command chain:
./open_spiel/scripts/build_only.sh interstate && pip install -e . --no-build-isolation && python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py

Or broken down:

1. Rebuild just the interstate game (fastest C++ build):
./open_spiel/scripts/build_only.sh interstate
2. Update Python bindings (development install):
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
3. Run the test:
python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py

Even Faster (if you're iterating):

After the first build, you can often skip the pip install step if you're only changing C++ implementation (not headers or interfaces):

./open_spiel/scripts/build_only.sh interstate && python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py

This typically takes less than 10 seconds for rebuilding just the interstate game and running the tests!


## Most Common Commands

./open_spiel/scripts/build_only.sh interstate
./build/examples/console --game=interstate
python open_spiel/python/tests/games_interstate_test.py
./open_spiel/scripts/buildpiptest.sh interstate
./open_spiel/scripts/buildtest.sh interstate


## TODO:
- Figure out how to enumerate (or assign action indices) to all the ways that someone can claim a path. Maybe it means discrete actions for selecting resources? There needs to be some 1-n translation of web-site actions to granular game actions.
- Figure out "MaxChanceOutcomes" for InterstateGame.
- Finish implementing "DoApplyAction" for the Faceup Spot Actions
