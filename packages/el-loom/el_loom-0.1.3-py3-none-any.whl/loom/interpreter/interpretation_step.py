@dataclass
class InterpretationStep:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    """
    The `InterpretationStep` class stores all relevant information which was
    generated during interpretation up to the `Operation` which is currently
    interpreted. In every interpretation step, the old `InterpretationStep` instance is
    replaced with an updated instance. After all `Operation`\\s have been interpreted,
    the last `InterpretationStep` instance contains the final output.

    NOTE on mutability: During the interpretation of an EKA, there is a lot of data
    generated and modified which is stored inside the `InterpretationStep` objects.
    Having the `InterpretationStep` dataclass mutable makes it a lot easier to modify
    the data during interpretation. Therefore many of the convenience methods here have
    side effects on `InterpretationStep`. To make these side effects explicit, those
    methods with side effects have the suffix `_MUT` in their name. This follows the
    Julia convention where functions with side effects have a ``!`` at the end of their
    name.

    NOTE: The operations implemented inside the `applicators` are not pure
    functions, they take the previous `InterpretationStep` as an input and returning an
    updated `InterpretationStep`, effectively emulating that behavior. Make sure to
    always keep track of the `InterpretationStep` you are currently working on,
    since it is updated with every operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    intermediate_circuit_sequence : tuple[tuple[Circuit, ...], ...]
        The circuit implementing all `Operation` s which have been interpreted until
        now. It consists of a tuple of timeslices, where each timeslice is a tuple of
        `Circuit` objects. They can be composite circuits. At the final step, this is
        used to generate final_circuit.
    final_circuit : Circuit | None
        The final circuit object which is generated after interpreting all operations.
        This is the circuit which is used for the final output of the interpretation, it
        is generated automatically by interpreting all operations.
    block_history : tuple[tuple[Block, ...], ...]
        A history of block configurations. The last element in the tuple is the current
        configuration of blocks. With the interpretation of every `Operation` a new
        tuple of blocks is added to this `block_history` field. While mostly only the
        last configuration of blocks is relevant, the whole history is stored which
        might be useful for plotting.
    syndromes : tuple[Syndrome, ...]
        A tuple of `Syndrome`s which are created due to all syndrome extraction cycles
        up to the `Operation` which is currently interpreted.
    detectors : tuple[Detector, ...]
        A tuple of `Detector`s which are created due to all syndrome extraction cycles
        up to the `Operation` which is currently interpreted.
    logical_observables : tuple[LogicalObservable, ...]
        A tuple of `LogicalObservable` s which were measured until now.
    stabilizer_evolution : dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
        Keeps track of which stabilizers transformed into which other stabilizers due to
        operations such as shrink or split. The dictionary is a FINAL-to-INITIAL
        mapping. In most cases both key and value will be a single string and there is a
        1:1 mapping from an old stabilizer to a new stabilizer. If there is a case where
        multiple stabilizers are combined into a single stabilizer, the value will be a
        tuple of strings. Conversely, if a single stabilizer is split into multiple
        stabilizers, two keys would be associated with the same value.
        E.g. for a split we match `new_stab1.uuid` to `(old_stab.uuid,)` and
        `new_stab2.uuid` to `(old_stab.uuid,)`. For a situation where we merge two
        stabilizers, we match `merged_stab.uuid` to `(old_stab1.uuid, old_stab.uuid)` .
    logical_x_evolution : dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
        Keeps track of which logical X operator(s) transformed into which other logical
        X operator(s) due to operations such as shrink or split and eventual
        stabilizer(s) required to go from one to the next. The dictionary is a
        FINAL-to-INITIAL mapping.
        E.g. for a split we match `split_x_op1.uuid` to `(old_x_op.uuid,)` and
        `split_x_op2.uuid` to `(old_x_op.uuid,)`. For a shrink that moved the X operator
        using adjacent stabilizers, we match `new_x_op.uuid` to
        `(old_x_op.uuid, stab1.uuid, stab2.uuid)`.
    logical_z_evolution : dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
        Keeps track of which logical Z operator(s) transformed into which other logical
        Z operator(s) due to operations such as shrink or split and eventual
        stabilizer(s) required to go from one to the next. The dictionary is a
        FINAL-to-INITIAL mapping.
        E.g. for a split we match `split_z_op1.uuid` to `(old_z_op.uuid,)` and
        `split_z_op2.uuid` to `(old_z_op.uuid,)`. For a shrink that moved the Z operator
        using adjacent stabilizers, we match `new_z_op.uuid` to
        `(old_z_op.uuid, stab1.uuid, stab2.uuid)`.
    block_evolution : dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
        Keeps track of which block(s) transformed into which other block(s) due to
        operations such as merge and split. If there is a 1:1 mapping between and old
        block and a new block (e.g. due to renaming), the value will be a
        tuple containing a single string. If one block is split into two blocks, two
        keys will be associated to the same value that is a tuple containing a single
        string. If two blocks are merged into a single block, the key will be a single
        string and the value will be a tuple of two strings.
        E.g. for a merge, we match `merged_block.uuid` to `(block1.uuid, block2.uuid)`.
    block_qec_rounds : dict[str, int]
        A dictionary storing for every block id how many syndrome extraction rounds have
        been performed on this block. This is needed for creating new `Syndrome` and
        `Detector` objects which have a `round` attribute, specifying the syndrome
        extraction round of the block in which they were measured.
    cbit_counter : dict[str, int]
        A dictionary storing how many measurements have been performed and stored in
        each classical register. The keys are the labels of the classical registers
        which are used as the first element in `Cbit`.
    block_decoding_starting_round : dict[str, int]
        A dictionary storing for every block the round from which the decoding of this
        block should start the next time real-time decoding is performed. E.g. if we
        encounter a non-Clifford gate on a block at time t, we need to decode until this
        time t. Then in this dictionary, we store that the next decoding round has to
        include detectors up to time t+1.
    logical_x_operator_updates : dict[str, tuple[Cbit, ...]]
        A dictionary storing for every logical X operator, the measurements (in the form
        of Cbits) which need to be taken into account for updating the Pauli frame of
        this logical operator once this operator is measured. Elements will be added
        here when some of the data qubits of the respective logical operator are
        measured, e.g. in a shrink or split operation. In this case, these measurements
        lead to a change of pauli frame and need to be included in the next readout of
        this operator. This is also needed for real-time decoding. The values can be
        accessed via `logical_x_operator_updates[logical_x.uuid]`.
        E.g. for a shrink of length 2 we match `new_x_op.uuid` to `(cbit1, cbit2,)`.
    logical_z_operator_updates : dict[str, tuple[Cbit, ...]]
        A dictionary storing for every logical Z operator, the measurements (in the form
        of Cbits) which need to be taken into account for updating the Pauli frame of
        this logical operator once this operator is measured. Elements will be added
        here when some of the data qubits of the respective logical operator are
        measured, e.g. in a shrink or split operation. In this case, these measurements
        lead to a change of pauli frame and need to be included in the next readout of
        this operator. This is also needed for real-time decoding. The values can be
        accessed via `logical_z_operator_updates[logical_x.uuid]`.
        E.g. for a shrink of length 2 we match `new_z_op.uuid` to `(cbit1, cbit2,)`.
    stabilizer_updates : dict[str, tuple[Cbit, ...]]
        A dictionary storing updates for stabilizers which need to be included when the
        stabilizer is measured the next time. Elements will be added here when some of
        the data qubits of the respective stabilizer are measured (in other words when
        the weight of the stabilizer is reduced), e.g. in a shrink or split operation.
        The keys of the dictionary are uuids of stabilizers.
        E.g. for a shrink that changes a weight 4 stabilizer to a weight 2 stabilizer
        we match `new_stab.uuid` to `(cbit1, cbit2)`.
        CAUTION:
        Some applicators may pop the entries from the stabilizer_updates field of the
        interpretation step to compute corrections. This may cause issues in the future
        if the information in this field also needs to be accessed somewhere else.
    channel_dict : dict[str, Channel]
        A dictionary storing all channels which have been created during the
        interpretation. The keys are the labels of the channels (which are either the
        qubit coordinates or the Cbit tuple). The values are the `Channel` objects.
        Only one Channel is created per qubit. Measurements are associated to individual
        channels. I.e. for every Cbit, there is a separate Channel object.
    is_frozen : bool
        A boolean flag, indicating whether the `InterpretationStep` is frozen. If it is
        set to True (frozen), calling methods which mutate the `InterpretationStep` will
        raise an exception. Defaults to False.
