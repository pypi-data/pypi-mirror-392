    Measure the syndromes of all stabilizers in a block.

    The algorithm is the following:
    
    - A.) For each stabilizer in the block, get the corresponding circuit (template)
    
        - A.1) Get the stabilizers from the block
        - A.2) Get the stabilizer circuit templates from the block
        
    - B.) Resolve the circuit with actual channels:
    
        - B.1) Get the qubit labels from the stabilizer
        - B.2) Get the classical bit labels from the syndrome circuit
        - B.3) Repeat for n_cycle:
        
            - B.3.1) Find the classical channels (create them if they don't exist) and \
            create cbits
            - B.3.2) Clone the syndrome circuit and remap the channels
        
    - C.) Weave circuits together: NOTE we currently assume that the circuits are \
    constructed in order, this is the responsibility of the user.
    
        - C.1) Check the assumption that all circuits are the same length
        - C.2) Add gates one by one to the intermediate circuit
        
    - D.) Generate new syndromes for the stabilizers involved
    
    - E.) Create new detectors for the new syndromes
    
    - F.) Update the interpretation_step with the new syndromes and detectors
    
    - G.) Update the interpretation_step with the new circuit

    Parameters
    ----------
    interpretation_step : InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step containing the block from which the 
        syndrome should be measured.
    operation : MeasureBlockSyndromes
        Syndrome measurement operation description.
    same_timeslice : bool
        Flag indicating whether the operation is part of the same timestep as the
        previous operation.
    debug_mode : bool
        Flag indicating whether the interpretation should be done in debug mode.
        Activating debug mode will enable commutation validation for Block.

    Returns
    -------
    InterpretationStep
        Interpretation step after the syndrome measurement operation.
