"""
VASP Calculation Monitoring Functions.

This module provides monitoring functions for detecting and handling problems that may occur
during VASP calculations running on remote machines. These monitors are designed to identify
issues early and take preventive actions to avoid system crashes or resource waste.

The monitoring functions can detect:

* Stdout file overflow that could crash the AiiDA daemon
* Electronic loop timing issues that indicate inefficient calculations
* Stalled calculations that are no longer making progress

These monitors are typically used by AiiDA's calculation monitoring system to provide
real-time feedback about running VASP calculations and automatically handle problematic
situations.

.. note::
   These monitors operate on the remote machine where the VASP calculation is running
   and require a transport connection to access files and execute commands.

    Monitor stdout file size to prevent overflow crashes.

    This function monitors the size of the VASP stdout file during calculation execution.
    If the file becomes too large, it indicates a potential problem (such as excessive
    output from convergence issues) that could crash the AiiDA daemon when attempting
    to retrieve and parse the file.

    When an oversized stdout file is detected, the function automatically truncates it
    to prevent system crashes, though this means the calculation is considered lost.

       When stdout overflow is detected, the calculation is automatically terminated

       The default threshold of 5 MB is typically sufficient for normal VASP
       calculations. Larger thresholds may be needed for very large systems or
       calculations with verbose output.

    Monitor electronic loop timing to detect inefficient or stalled calculations.

    This function analyzes the timing of electronic self-consistency loops in VASP
    calculations to identify potential problems:

    1. **Slow convergence**: If electronic loops take too long relative to the walltime
       limit, the calculation may not complete within the allocated time.

    2. **Stalled calculations**: If the stdout file hasn't been updated for an
       extended period, the calculation may have crashed or become stuck.

    The function examines the OUTCAR file to extract loop timing information and
    compares it against the walltime limits and recent file modification times.
