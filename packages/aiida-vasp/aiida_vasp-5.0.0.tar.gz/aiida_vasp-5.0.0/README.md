This is a plugin to [AiiDA] to run calculations with the ab-initio program [VASP].

Please have a look at the [AiiDA-VASP documentation] for instructions on how to install and use the plugin.

## Installing the plugin

1. If you are already using [AiiDA], simply activate the virtual environment associated with it, here assumed to be located in `~/env/aiida-vasp`:

   ```
   $ source ~/env/aiida-vasp/bin/activate
   ```

2. Otherwise, set up a new virtual environment:

   ```
   $ python -m venv ~/env/aiida-vasp
   ```

3. And then enable the newly installed virtual environment:

   ```
   $ source ~/env/aiida-vasp/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install the [AiiDA-VASP] plugin (and [AiiDA] if that is not already installed):

   ```
   (aiida-vasp) $   pip install aiida-vasp
   ```

5. Verify that the plugin is correctly installed:
   ```
   (aiida-vasp) $ verdi plugin list aiida.calculations
   ```
   which should give:
   ```bash
   Registered entry points for aiida.calculations:
   * core.arithmetic.add
   * core.templatereplacer
   * core.transfer
   * vasp.immigrant
   * vasp.neb
   * vasp.vasp
   * vasp.vasp2w90
   ```

This will automatically install the [AiiDA] python package(s) as well as any other dependencies of the plugin and register all the plugin classes with [AiiDA].

Please consider that [AiiDA] has prerequisites that need to be installed and ensured working. The steps above will not take care of this for you. Please consult [AiiDA prerequisites] and follow the instructions therein.

> Legacy support: If you need to install the compatibility release of [AiiDA-VASP] which works with [AiiDA] 1.6.4 you should instead install the plugin
> using `pip install aiida-vasp=2.2`, but this is not recommended and only mentioned for legacy support. For the legacy version you
> also most likely have to run `reentry scan -r aiida` after installing the plugin.
