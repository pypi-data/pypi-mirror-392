# Realization Plan: [NAME]

**Context**: `[###-context-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Specification from context

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/{{ cli_prefix }}.plan` command.

## Summary

[Extract from specification: primary requirement + approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Primary Method**: [e.g., declarative, procedural, interactive or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Key Dependencies**: [e.g., libraries, tools, services or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., database, files, memory or N/A]  
**Validation**: [e.g., validation approach or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Environment**: [e.g., platform, environment or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Artifact Type**: [single/multi-component - determines structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific goals or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific constraints or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific scale or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]
