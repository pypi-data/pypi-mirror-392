## Checklist Purpose

This checklist is a **"Unit Test for Specifications"** - it validates the quality, clarity, and completeness of the toolkit specification itself.

**What this checklist does**:
- ✅ Validates requirement quality (completeness, clarity, consistency)
- ✅ Identifies gaps, ambiguities, and conflicts in the spec
- ✅ Ensures specifications are measurable and testable
- ✅ Checks constitution alignment

**What this checklist does NOT do**:
- ❌ Test if implementation works correctly
- ❌ Verify code functionality
- ❌ Check if tests pass

## How to Use

1. **Read each item** carefully
2. **Check the spec** (not the code) for the referenced requirement
3. **Mark [x]** if the specification quality criterion is met
4. **Leave [ ]** if the spec needs improvement
5. **Add notes** below items if issues found
6. **Update spec** to address gaps/ambiguities
7. **Re-check** items after spec updates
