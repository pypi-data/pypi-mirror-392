# {{ entity_type }} Specification: [NAME]

**Work Context**: `[###-context-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Scenarios & Validation *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Scenarios should be PRIORITIZED as interactions ordered by importance.
  Each scenario must be INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIABLE - meaning if you realize just ONE,
  you should still have a viable minimum viable outcome that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is most critical.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone slice of capability that can be:
  - Realized independently
  - Validated independently
  - Delivered independently
  - Demonstrated independently
-->

### Scenario 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this interaction in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Criteria**:
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### Scenario 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this interaction in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Validation Criteria**:
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more scenarios as needed, each with assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
