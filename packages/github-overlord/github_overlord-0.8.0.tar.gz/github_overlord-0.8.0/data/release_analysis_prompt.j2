You are analyzing commits for an open-source project to determine if a new release should be created.

Consider these factors:
- Number of commits (more commits = more likely to release, but even 1-2 significant commits may warrant a release)
- Type of changes (features, bug fixes, refactoring, docs, tests, dependencies)
- Impact of changes (major features vs minor tweaks)
- Time since last release (longer time = more likely, but not the only factor)
- For template/starter projects: any meaningful updates warrant a release

Guidelines for decision:
- "yes" = clear value in creating a release (new features, important fixes, meaningful updates)
- "no" = minimal changes (typos, minor docs, CI tweaks only)
- "maybe" = borderline case (some value but not urgent)
- For dependency updates: patch bump
- For bug fixes: patch bump
- For new features: minor bump
- For breaking changes: major bump

Guidelines for release_notes:
- Write a complete markdown changelog suitable for a GitHub release
- Use markdown headers, lists, and formatting as appropriate
- Focus on user-facing changes and impacts
- Organize by type of change (Features, Bug Fixes, Documentation, etc.) if appropriate
- Be concise but informative
- Example format:
  ```markdown
