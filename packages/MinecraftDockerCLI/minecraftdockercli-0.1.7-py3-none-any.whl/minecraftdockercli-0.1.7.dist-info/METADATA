**MinecraftDockerCLI** is a python CLI application to allow minecraft server admins to set up in a fast and easy way a server or a network using docker containers.
**MinecraftDockerCLI** is orientated towards minecraft server admins that administrate networks, since a single server cannot fully use the advantages of Docker containers. Docker containers make minecraft networks easier and cleaner because of how docker containers work and intercomunicate on the same machine.

## **Installation**

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Engine (Docker Desktop on Windows) running and configured.
- Docker Compose (bundled with modern Docker Desktop installations).
- Python 3.13+ and `pip`.

**Recommended Installation:**

```shell
# Create a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install the python package
pip install MinecraftDockerCLI
```
<br>

**Clone repo:**

Extra requirement: `Poetry`.

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dtar380/Minecraft-Dockerfile-CLI.git
cd Minecraft-Dockerfile-CLI

poetry install
```

> [!NOTE]
> When running the program you would need to be using the poetry environment and run it like `poetry run MinecraftDockerCLI`

## **Usage**

To use this app you simply need to type `MinecraftDockerCLI` in your terminal followed by the command you want to execute and the options you want to use.

> [!WARNING]
> To ensure the app runs correctly, make sure the ENV you installed the app to is activated and that you are on the folder of your server project.

### **Builder commands**
Create:
- Help: Create all files for the containerization.
- Description: This command will ask the user with prompts everything to build a docker-compose.yml and .envs for all the services the user will run. Running this command on a existing project will overwrite the files.
- Arguments:
    - --network: Flag for creating network insteat of single server (required)

Update:
- Help: Update the contents of the containers.
- Description: This command will either delete a service or add a service with the same method as Create.
- Arguments:
    - --add: Flag to state the addition of a service.
    - --remove: Flag to state the removal of a service.
    - --service: Parameter to specify the name of the service.

Build:
- Help: Build the files for the containerization.
- Description: This command will build the files based on `data.json` in case they were not built when running create.

> [!NOTE]
> None of the Builder commands will build nor start the containers.

### **Manager commands**
Backup:
- Help: Create a backup of the containers.
- Description: This command will create a backup of every service in a tar file with the format `{service_name}_{date}.tar.gz` inside a `.backup` directory.

Up:
- Help: Build the containers and start them. (This will overwrite the data inside with the host data)
- Arguments:
    - --atached: Flag to run the containers in atached mode.

Down:
- Help: Stop the containers and delete them.
- Arguments:
    - --rm-volumes: Flag to remove volumes.

> [!WARNING]
> Running `Up` will overwrite the inside volumes of the container with host ones and down with --rm-files will remove the volumes inside the containers, make sure to create a backup and replace the files on host with the backups every time.

Start:
- Help: Start the containers.
- Description: This command will

Stop:
- Help: Stop the containers.
- Description: This command will

## **Tips & Troubleshooting**
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running and you can run `docker ps` without errors before invoking the CLI.
- On Windows, run PowerShell as Administrator or ensure your user has permissions for Docker.
- If `data.json` is missing, run `builder create` first to scaffold services.

## **Working On**
Currently resolving issues and developing the unit tests for future updates.
