class OcpiPriceComponent(BaseModel):
    '''
    OCPI 11.4.2. PriceComponent class

    NOTE: `step_size`: depends on the type and every type (except FLAT) defines a step_size multiplier, which is the
    size of every *step* for that type in the given unit.

    For example: `PARKING_TIME` has the `step_size` multiplier: *1 second*, which means that the step_size of a
    `PriceComponent` is multiplied by *1 second*. Thus a `step_size = 300` means `300 seconds` (`5 minutes`).
    This means that when someone parked for 8 minutes they will be billed for 10 minutes. The parking time will be
    simply rounded up to the next larger chunk of `step_size` (i.e. blocks of `300 seconds` in this example).

    Another example: `ENERGY` has the `step_size` multiplied: *1 Wh*, which means that the `step_size` of a
    `PriceComponent` is multiplied by *1 Wh*. Thus a `step_size = 1` with a `price = 0.25` will result in a cost
    calculation that uses the charged Wh as precision.  
    If someone charges their EV with 115.2 Wh, then they are billed for 116 Wh, resulting in total cost of 0.029 euro.
    When `step_size = 25`, then the same amount would be billed for 101 to 125 Wh: 0.031 euro.
    When `step_size = 500`, then the same amount will be billed for 1 to 500 Wh: 0.125 euro.

    NOTE: For more information about how `step_size` impacts the calculation of the cost of charging see: CDR object
    description

    NOTE: Take into account that using `step_size` can be confusing for customers/drivers. There may be local or national
    regulations that define max `step_size`. E.g. in The Netherlands telecom companies are required to at least
    offer one subscription which is paid per second. To prevent confusion by the customer, we recommend to keep
    the step_size as small as possible and mention them clearly in your offering.

class OcpiTariff(BaseModel):
    '''
    OCPI 11.3.1. Tariff Object

    A Tariff object consists of a list of one or more Tariff Elements, which can be used to create complex Tariff structures.

    When the list of Tariff Elements contains more than one Element with the same Tariff Dimension (ENERGY/FLAT/TIME etc.), than
    the first Tariff Element with that Dimension in the list with matching Tariff Restrictions will be used. Only one Tariff per Element type
    can be active at any point in time, but multiple Tariff Types can be active at once. IE you can have an ENERGY element and TIME
    element active at the same time, but only the first valid element of each.

    When no Tariff Element with a specific Dimension is found for which the Restrictions match, and there is no Tariff Element in the list
    with the given Dimension without Restrictions, there will be no costs for that Tariff Dimension.

    It is advised to always add a "default" Tariff Element per Dimension (ENERGY/FLAT/TIME etc.). This can be achieved by adding a
    Tariff Element without Restrictions after all other occurrences of the same Dimension in the list of Tariff Elements (the order is
    important). Such a Tariff Element will act as fallback when no other Tariff Element of a specific Dimension matches the relevant
    parameters (Restrictions).

    To define a "Free of Charge" tariff in OCPI, a Tariff with `type = FLAT` and `price = 0.00` has to be provided. See: Free of Charge
    Tariff example

    NOTE: `min_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where minimum cost
    including VAT is reached earlier or later than the minimum cost excluding VAT. So as a rule, they both apply: -
    The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` excluding VAT. -
    The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be lower than the `min_price` including VAT.

    NOTE: `max_price`: As the VAT might be built up of different parts, there might be situations where maximum cost
    including VAT is reached earlier or later than the maximum cost excluding VAT. So as a rule, they both apply: -
    The total cost of a Charging Session excluding VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` excluding VAT. -
    The total cost of a Charging Session including VAT can never be higher than the `max_price` including VAT.

    NOTE: `start_date_time` and `end_date_time`: When the Tariff of a Charge Point (Location) is changed during an
    ongoing charging session, it is common to not switch the Tariff until the ongoing session is finished. But this is
    NOT a requirement of OCPI, it is even possible with OCPI. Changing tariffs during an ongoing session is in many
    countries not allowed by consumer legislation. When charging at a Charge Point, a driver accepts the tariff which
    is valid when they start their charging session. If the Tariff of the Charge Point would change during the charging
    session, the driver might get billed something they didn't agree to when starting the session.

    NOTE: The fields: `tariff_alt_text` and `tariff_alt_url` may be used separately, or in combination with each
    other or even combined with the structured tariff elements. When a Tariff contains both the tariff_alt_text
    and elements fields, the tariff_alt_text SHALL only contain additional tariff information in human-
    readable text, not the price information that is also available via the elements field. Reason for this: the eMSP
    might have additional fees they want to include in communication with their customer.
