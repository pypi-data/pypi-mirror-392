    OCPI 12.3.2. Token Object

    - `uid`:
        Unique ID by which this Token, combined with the Token type, can be identified.
        This is the field used by CPO system (RFID reader on the Charge Point) to
        identify this token.
        Currently, in most cases: type=RFID, this is the RFID hidden ID as read by the
        RFID reader, but that is not a requirement.
        If this is a `APP_USER` or `AD_HOC_USER` Token, it will be a uniquely, by the eMSP,
        generated ID.
        This field is named `uid` instead of `id` to prevent confusion with: `contract_id`.
    - `contract_id`:
        Uniquely identifies the EV Driver contract token within the eMSP’s platform (and
        suboperator platforms). Recommended to follow the specification for eMA ID
        from "eMI3 standard version V1.0" (http://emi3group.com/documents-links/)
        "Part 2: business objects."
    - `group_id`:
        This ID groups a couple of tokens. This can be used to make two or more
        tokens work as one, so that a session can be started with one token and
        stopped with another, handy when a card and key-fob are given to the EV-driver.
        Beware that OCPP 1.5/1.6 only support group_ids (it is called parentId in OCPP
        1.5/1.6) with a maximum length of 20.
    - `language`:
        Language Code ISO 639-1. This optional field indicates the Token owner’s
        preferred interface language. If the language is not provided or not supported
        then the CPO is free to choose its own language.
    - `default_profile_type`:
        he default Charging Preference. When this is provided, and a charging session
        is started on an Charge Point that support Preference base Smart Charging and
        support this ProfileType, the Charge Point can start using this ProfileType,
        without this having to be set via: Set Charging Preferences.
    - `energy_contract`:
        When the Charge Point supports using your own energy supplier/contract at a
        Charge Point, information about the energy supplier/contract is needed so the
        CPO knows which energy supplier to use.
        NOTE: In a lot of countries it is currently not allowed/possible to use a drivers
        own energy supplier/contract at a Charge Point.

    The combination of _uid_ and _type_ should be unique for every token within the eMSP’s system.

    NOTE: OCPP supports group_id (or ParentID as it is called in OCPP 1.5/1.6) OCPP 1.5/1.6 only support group ID’s with
    maximum length of string(20), case insensitive. As long as EV-driver can be expected to charge at an OCPP
    1.5/1.6 Charge Point, it is adviced to not used a group_id longer then 20.
