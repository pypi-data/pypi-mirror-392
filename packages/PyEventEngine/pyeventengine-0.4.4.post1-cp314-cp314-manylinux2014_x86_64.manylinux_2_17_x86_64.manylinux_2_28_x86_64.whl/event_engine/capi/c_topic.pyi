class PyTopic:
    """High-level Python representation of a parsed topic.

    PyTopic instances internalize their literal content into a shared internal buffer / ByteMap.
    All topics created via the normal constructor are internalized into the global ByteMap and do not
    own the underlying character storage (the buffer is bound to the global map).

    Examples:

        >>> # This internalizes the literal string "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH" into the global ByteMap
        ... t1 = PyTopic("Realtime.TickData.600010.SH")
        >>> assert not t1.owner

        >>> # Because t1 does not own its buffer we can create another topic with the same literal string
        ... t2 = PyTopic.__new__(PyTopic, "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH")
        >>> # Creation of t2 is faster due to internalization.
        ... assert id(t1) != id(t2)

        ``t1`` and ``t2`` are different Python objects but may share the same underlying buffer address.
        If the allocator is initialized with shared memory, another process can also create topics
        referencing the same internal ByteMap.

    Topic parser
        The separator, option delimiter and wildcard/pattern markers can be customized at build time by
        changing the following C macros before compiling the extension:

        ```
        #define DEFAULT_TOPIC_SEP '.'
        #define DEFAULT_OPTION_SEP '|'
        #define DEFAULT_RANGE_BRACKETS "()"
        #define DEFAULT_WILDCARD_MARKER '+'
        #define DEFAULT_PATTERN_DELIM '/'
        ```

        For example, compile with ``-DDEFAULT_TOPIC_SEP='/'`` to change the topic separator to ``/``.

        When parsing a topic string:
        - If the pattern delimiter appears in balanced pairs, the enclosed text is parsed as a regex
          pattern part (``PyTopicPartPattern``).
        - A part beginning with the wildcard marker is parsed as a wildcard part (``PyTopicPartAny``).
        - A part enclosed by the range brackets and containing the option separator (or NUL) is parsed
          as a range part (``PyTopicPartRange``). Options are separated by the option separator or NUL;
          empty options are not allowed.
        - All other parts are parsed as exact literal parts (``PyTopicPartExact``).

    Example:

        >>> t = PyTopic(r'Realtime.(TickData|TradeData)./^[0-9]{6}\.(SZ|SH)$/.+suffix')
        ... for tp in t:
        >>>     print(tp)
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="Realtime")
        <TopicPartRange>(n=2, options=['TickData', 'TradeData'])
        <TopicPartPattern>(regex="^[0-9]{6}\.(SZ|SH)$")
        <TopicPartAny>(name="suffix")

        >>> t = PyTopic('Realtime.TickData.{ticker}')
        ... for tp in t:
        ...     print(tp)
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="Realtime")
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="TickData")
        <TopicPartAny>(name="ticker")
        Malformed or ill-formatted literal strings may raise MemoryError during parsing.

    Owning a topic (lazy init)
        To create a topic that owns its internal buffer (``owner`` is True), use lazy initialization:

        >>> t3 = PyTopic.__new__(PyTopic, alloc=True)  # create an empty topic with allocated buffer
        >>> assert t3.owner
        >>> t3.value = "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH"    # set the value once
        ... assert t3.value == "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH"
        >>> assert t3.owner

    Note:
        assigning a literal that includes the topic separator inside a logical part (for example a ticker like ``"600010.SH"``)
        will be split by the parser into multiple parts:

        >>> t3[-2], t3[-1]
        (<TopicPartExact>(topic="600010"), <TopicPartExact>(topic="SH"))

        To avoid unwanted splitting, construct the topic from explicit parts:

        >>> t4 = PyTopic.from_parts([
        ...     PyTopicPartExact("Realtime", alloc=True),
        ...     PyTopicPartExact("TickData", alloc=True),
        ...     PyTopicPartExact("600010.SH", alloc=True),
        ... ])
        >>> assert t4.value == "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH"
        >>> t4[-1]
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="600010.SH")

        Or use the convenience join helper:

        >>> t5 = PyTopic.join(["Realtime", "TickData", "600010.SH"])
        ... assert t5.value == "Realtime.TickData.600010.SH"
        >>> t5[-1]
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="600010.SH")

    Empty parts and parsing caveats
        The topic string must not contain empty parts. For example, ``"Realtime..TickData"``:

        >>> t6 = PyTopic("Realtime..TickData")
        ... for tp in t6:
        >>>     print(tp)
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="Realtime")
        <TopicPartExact>(topic="TickData")

        The empty part is ignored during parsing (parsed parts omit the empty entry) but the literal string
        remains unchanged:

        >>> t6.value
        'Realtime..TickData'

        This inconsistency between the literal string and parsed parts can be confusing—use with caution.

    Notes on internalization and lifecycle
        - PyTopic instances internalize their literal content into a shared global ByteMap.
        - When two PyTopic objects are created from the same literal string key, the underlying buffer
          for that literal is shared (same numeric address in the ByteMap). Topics remain distinct Python
          objects but can share storage.
        - Because of internalization, avoid frequent create/destroy cycles; prefer reusing instances or a
          global TopicSet-style registry.
        - Setting the ``value`` attribute mutates internalized storage and triggers de-register / re-register
          in the internal mapping. This is an expensive operation; prefer lazy-init (create an empty owning
          topic and set ``value`` once).
        - ``__init__`` does not support escape characters; for complex topics that require escaping use
          ``from_parts`` or ``join``.
        - Empty topic parts are not allowed; inputs with empty parts are parsed by ignoring the empties and
          preserving the original literal string.
