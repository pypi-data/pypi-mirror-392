class ContrastiveLoss(Loss):
    """
    Custom implementation of Contrastive loss for training models with the
    contrastive loss function, commonly used in similarity learning tasks, such as
    metric learning and Siamese networks.

    The contrastive loss function is designed to minimize the distance between similar pairs
    and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs, where the similarity of a pair is
    typically indicated by a binary label (1 for similar, 0 for dissimilar).

    Mathematical Formula:
    ---------------------
    The contrastive loss for a pair of embeddings y1 and y2 is computed as:

        L = (1/N) * sum_i [ y_i * D^2 + (1 - y_i) * max(0, m - D)^2 ]

    Where:
        - y_i is the binary label indicating whether the pair is similar (y_i = 1) or dissimilar (y_i = 0).
        - D is the Euclidean distance between the two embeddings: D = ||y1 - y2||.
        - m is the margin, a hyperparameter that defines the minimum distance between dissimilar pairs. Default is 1.0.
        - N is the number of pairs in the batch.

    Args:
        margin (float): The margin value for the contrastive loss function. Default is 1.0. This margin is used
                        to separate dissimilar pairs, ensuring they are at least this distance apart.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the base `loss` class.

    Attributes:
        margin (float): The margin value for the contrastive loss function.

    Example
    -------
        >>> # Create a ContrastiveLoss object with a margin of 1.0
        ...     contrastive_loss_layer = ContrastiveLoss(margin=1.0)
        ...     # Example tensors for true labels and predicted embeddings
        ...     y_true = tensorflow.constant([1, 0, 1])  # Labels: 1 for similar, 0 for dissimilar
        ...     y_pred = tensorflow.random.normal((2, 3, 128))  # Predicted embeddings of shape (2, batch_size, embedding_dim)
        ...     # Compute the contrastive loss
        ...     loss = contrastive_loss_layer(y_true, y_pred)
        >>>     print(loss)
