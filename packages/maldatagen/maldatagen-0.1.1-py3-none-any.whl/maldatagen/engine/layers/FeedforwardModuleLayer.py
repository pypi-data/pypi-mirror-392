class FeedForwardModule(Layer):
    """
    Feed-Forward Neural Network Module with Dense layers and Dropout.

    This module consists of two dense layers with an activation function and
    dropout applied between them. The goal of this module is to process data
    through a fully connected network with regularization techniques, making
    it suitable for tasks like classification, regression, and feature
    transformation in deep learning architectures.

    The first dense layer increases the dimensionality of the input (projection),
    and the second dense layer reduces it back to the original embedding dimension.

    Args:
        @embedding_dimension (int): The dimensionality of the output embeddings
         (final output size). Default is 64.
        @dropout_rate (float): The dropout rate to apply after each dense layer
         to prevent overfitting. Default is 0.1.
        @activation_function (function): The activation function to apply to the
         first dense layer. Default is Swish.
        @factor_projection (int): The factor by which to increase the dimensionality
         in the first dense layer. Default is 4.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to the base Layer class.

    Attributes:
        @embedding_dimension (int): Dimensionality of the output embeddings.
        @dropout_rate (float): Dropout rate applied after each dense layer.
        @activation_function (function): Activation function used in the first
         dense layer.
        @factor_projection (int): Factor by which the dimensionality is increased in
         the first dense layer.
        @first_dense_layer (Dense): The first dense layer, applying the activation
         function and dimensionality projection.
        @dropout1 (Dropout): Dropout layer applied after the first dense layer.
        @second_dense_layer (Dense): The second dense layer, reducing the dimensionality
         to the original embedding dimension.
        @dropout2 (Dropout): Dropout layer applied after the second dense layer.

    Example
    -------
        >>>  # Create an instance of the FeedForwardModule with custom parameters
        ...     ff_module = FeedForwardModule(embedding_dimension=128, dropout_rate=0.2)
        ...     # Example input tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)
        ...     input_tensor = tf.random.normal([32, 100, 64])  # Batch of 32, sequence length of 100, and 64 features
        ...     # Apply the feedforward module to the input tensor
        ...     output_tensor = ff_module(input_tensor)
        ...     # Print the output shape
        >>>     print("Output tensor shape:", output_tensor.shape)

    Output:
