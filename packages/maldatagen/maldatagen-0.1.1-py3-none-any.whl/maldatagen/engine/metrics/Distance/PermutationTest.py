    """
    A class for performing a Permutation test to compare two binary distributions.

    Attributes:
        n_permutations (int): Number of permutations to perform (default: 1000).
        random_state (int): Seed for reproducibility (default: None).

    Methods:
        get_metric(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the p-value using permutation test.

        _calculate_statistic(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the test statistic (difference of means by default).

    Exceptions:
        PermutationTestError: Custom exception class for handling permutation test errors.

    Example:
        # Create an instance of the PermutationTest class
        permutation_test = PermutationTest(n_permutations=1000, random_state=42)

        # Define two binary distributions as numpy arrays
