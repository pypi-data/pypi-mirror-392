    A class for calculating Jaccard Distance and Mean Jaccard Distance between two binary distributions.

    Attributes:

    Methods:
        get_metric(first_distribution, second_distribution):
            Calculate the Mean Jaccard Distance between two binary distributions.

    Exceptions:

        first_distribution = np.array([1, 0, 1, 1])
