class Plot:

    Abstract base class for plot generation.

    Provides core functionality for:
    - Managing plot output directory
    - Reading and parsing JSON data files
    - Template method pattern for value extraction

    Subclasses must implement the _get_values() method to specify how to extract
    relevant data from the JSON structure for their specific plot type.

        Read and process multiple JSON data files.

        Returns:
            Dictionary mapping each file path to its extracted values.
            The structure of the values is determined by the _get_values() implementation.
