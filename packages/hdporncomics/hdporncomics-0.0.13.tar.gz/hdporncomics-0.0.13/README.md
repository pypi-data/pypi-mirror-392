# Output examples

Are created by `create-format-examples` script and contained in [examples](https://github.com/TUVIMEN/hdporncomics/tree/master/examples) directory. Files are in `json` format.

# Usage

## CLI

THIS THING DOWNLOADS IMAGES!!!!!!!!!!!

[demonstration video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUVIMEN/hdporncomics/refs/heads/master/cli-usage-demonstration.mkv)

CLI interface uses very little of implemented functions and is used only for downloading comics/manhwas/chapters and pages of them.

Download resource from URLs into DIR

    hdporncomics --directory DIR URL1 URL2 URL3

This will create separate directory named by title of resource where images and data will be stored e.g. for `https://hdporncomics.com/myaxx-human-experiments-planz34-sex-comic/` it will create

```
Myaxx Human Experiments
Myaxx Human Experiments/1.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/2.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/3.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/4.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/5.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/6.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/7.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/8.jpg
Myaxx Human Experiments/info.json
```

where `info.json` stores the basic information. By default comments are not scraped if you want to get all comments for all resources use `--comment-limit -1` option. You can also save chapters as `--pdf` or `--cbz` files instead.

Getting manhwas will create chapters directories under the directory of manhwa.

Pages of things don't create directories for themselves but they still create `info.json` although in different format.

By default images are named by their order and stylized with zeroes - this is much more practical approach as it won't mess up order of them by sorting files. If you want to have the original names use the `--no-num-images` option.

Download only images without metadata using 8 threads (only images are downloaded using multiple threads)

    hdporncomics --directory DIR --threads 8 --images-only URL1 URL2 URL3

Download comics with all comments and wait 1.2 seconds in between requests and randomly up to 0.8 seconds (waiting time doesn't affect downloading images)

    hdporncomics --directory DIR --wait 1.2 --wait-random 0.8 URL1 URL2

Download resources from URLs annotating their type

    hdporncomics --directory DIR --chapter URL1 --chapter URL2 --pages URL3 --comic URL4 --manhwa URL5 URL6 URL7

### General

`--directory DIR` - enter directory before downloading

`--force` - overwrite things

### Settings

## Scraping whole site

At the root of this project is a python tool named `hdporncomics-scrape`. It utilizes this library to scrape the whole site. It does so in a sophisticated way, going through all list pages until saved links don't start overlapping or until the views of already found resources are greater by the factor of 1.3 from the saved ones.

All gathered links are saved into `links` file. All resources are saved into their respective directory that can be `manhwachapter`, `comic`, `gay` or `manhwa`. All files under these are named by sha256 of their url.

All comments of resources are downloaded, exception to this are manhwa chapters since their comment section is the same as their parent manhwa.

After downloading all of these resources and their comment sections there is nothing on site that cannot be generated from these, so scraping things like artists, tags, genres is counter productive, if you need them generate them.

If this tool is run after some time it will update file structure with new resources and resources that got a lot of activity since.

This tool takes only one argument which is the working directory

    ./hdporncomics-scrape DIR

By default the waiting time is 1 second before each request, at this speed it takes about a week to finish everything. You may go faster, to change the waiting time go to the end of `hdporncomics-scrape` file and change the waiting argument of `hdporncomics` class.

As per 2025-03-28 file structure generated consists of:

| path         | size | file count   |
| ----         | ---- | ----------   |
| ./w          | 1.6G | 203645       |
| ./w/links    | 16M  | 203639 lines |
| ./w/comic    | 773M | 74323        |
| ./w/gay      | 476M | 38960        |
| ./w/manhwa   | 17M  | 1629         |
| ./w/chapters | 308M | 88727        |

Above that the count of images is 7579740

    find comic gay manhwachapter -type f | xargs -x -n 50 jq -r '.images | length' | awk '{ c += $0 } END { print c }'

and the count of comments is 587164

    find comic gay manhwa -type f | xargs -x -n 50 jq 'def tchild: . | map((.children | tchild) + 1) | add; .comments | tchild'  | awk '{ c += $0 } END { print c }'

If your script got interrupted in the middle of scraping, there is a chance that chapter links were not saved to `links` file, you can correct that by running

    { find manhwa -type f | xargs jq -r '.chapters[].link'; cat links; } | sort -u | sponge links
