"""Main MCP server implementation for Fantasy NBA League.

This MCP server provides access to a rotisserie (roto) fantasy basketball league.
Teams compete in 8 statistical categories, earning ranking points based on their
performance relative to other teams.

API ENDPOINTS OVERVIEW:

1. getTeams() - Get list of all teams and their IDs
2. getAveragesLeagueRankings() - Get ranking points and overall standings (ROTO SCORING)
3. getAverageStats() - Get actual statistical performance (per-game averages)
4. getTeamDetails() - Get comprehensive team data (combines rankings, stats, and roster)
5. getLeagueShotsStats() - Get shooting statistics (FG/FT totals and percentages)

KEY CONCEPTS:

RANKING POINTS vs ACTUAL STATS:
- getAveragesLeagueRankings() returns RANKING POINTS (roto scoring: 1-N points per category)
- getAverageStats() returns ACTUAL PERFORMANCE (e.g., 25.3 assists per game)
- getTeamDetails() provides BOTH types of data

ROTISSERIE SCORING SYSTEM:
- Teams are ranked 1st to Nth in each of 8 categories
- Best team gets N points, second-best gets N-1, worst gets 1
- total_points = sum of points from all 8 categories
- Overall rank is determined by total_points (highest total = rank 1)

8 STATISTICAL CATEGORIES:
- FG% (Field Goal Percentage)
- FT% (Free Throw Percentage)
- 3PM (Three-Pointers Made)
- AST (Assists)
- REB (Rebounds)
- STL (Steals - חטיפות in Hebrew)
- BLK (Blocks)
- PTS (Points)

def getAveragesLeagueRankings(order: str = "desc"):
    """
    Get the average league rankings from the API.
    
    IMPORTANT - SCORING SYSTEM EXPLANATION:
    This is a ROTISSERIE (ROTO) fantasy league. Teams earn ranking points in 8 categories.
    
    CRITICAL: Do NOT confuse "ranking points" with "rank position"!
    - Category values (fg_percentage, ast, reb, etc.) = POINTS earned (higher is better)
    - The "rank" field = actual position/place in standings (1 = first place)
    
    HOW RANKING POINTS WORK:
    - In each category, teams are ranked 1st to Nth (where N = number of teams)
    - Best team in a category gets N points, second-best gets N-1, worst gets 1
    - Example in 12-team league: 1st place = 12 pts, 2nd = 11 pts, ..., 12th = 1 pt
    - total_points = sum of points from all 8 categories
    - Overall "rank" is determined by total_points (highest total = rank 1)
    
    EXAMPLE in a 12-team league:
    {
        "team": {"team_name": "Best Team"},
        "ast": 12.0,           // Earned 12 pts (1st place in assists)
        "reb": 11.0,           // Earned 11 pts (2nd place in rebounds)
        "stl": 8.0,            // Earned 8 pts (5th place in steals)
        ...other categories...
        "total_points": 73.0,  // Sum of all 8 category points
        "rank": 1,             // Overall standing: 1st place
        "GP": 55               // Games played (informational only, not ranked)
    }
    
    Args:
        order: Sort order for rankings.
               - "desc" = best to worst (top teams first, "from top to bottom", "מלמעלה למטה")
               - "asc" = worst to best (bottom teams first, "from bottom to top", "מלמטה למעלה")
               Default is "desc".
    
    Returns:
        A list of teams with their rankings, total points, and stats per category.
        Each item in the list is a dictionary with the following keys: {
            "team": {
                "team_id": <team_id>,
                "team_name": <team_name>
            },
            "fg_percentage": <ranking_points_for_field_goal_percentage>,
            "ft_percentage": <ranking_points_for_free_throw_percentage>,
            "three_pm": <ranking_points_for_three_pointers_made>,
            "ast": <ranking_points_for_assists>,
            "reb": <ranking_points_for_rebounds>,
            "stl": <ranking_points_for_steals>,
            "blk": <ranking_points_for_blocks>,
            "pts": <ranking_points_for_points>,
            "total_points": <sum_of_all_category_ranking_points>,
            "rank": <overall_position_1_is_first_place>,
            "GP": <games_played_not_ranked>
        }
        
    NOTES:
    - Higher values in categories = better performance (more ranking points earned)
    - "rank" field is opposite: lower number = better (1 is first place)
    - GP (games played) is informational only, not used in scoring
    - When referring to steals in Hebrew, use חטיפות (not גניבות)
    - If you refer to comparing teams, distinguish between rank and total points, so f.e someone can be 1st place 70 total points and another team can be 2nd place 69 total points.
    - In that case, the difference is 2 points, not 1 place.

    3. Category ranks (position in each category, 1=best)
    4. Player roster with individual stats
    
    IMPORTANT - Understanding the Data Sections:

    RANKING STATS EXPLANATION (Same as getAveragesLeagueRankings):

    EXAMPLE - Understanding the Different Data Types:

    - ranking_stats.ast: 12.0 → Team earned 12 ranking points in assists (1st place in 12-team league)
    - category_ranks.AST: 1 → Team is ranked 1st in assists category
    
    NOTES:
    - Higher ranking_stats values = more points earned = better
    - Lower category_ranks values = better position (1 is first place)
    - raw_averages are the actual statistical performance
    - GP (games played) is informational only, not used in ranking calculations

#     Notes:
#         - Use the "status" field to filter between rostered players, free agents, and waivers
#         - Use "has_more" to determine if you need to fetch additional pages
#         - "total_count" tells you the total number of players available
#         - All stats are averaged per game except "gp" which is total games played

def getLeagueShotsStats():
    """
    Get league-wide shooting statistics (field goals and free throws) for all teams.
    
    This endpoint provides CUMULATIVE TOTALS (not per-game averages) for shooting stats.
    Useful for understanding overall team shooting efficiency across the season.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing league-wide shooting statistics: {
            "shots": [

        }

    NOTES:
    - fgm, fga, ftm, fta are TOTALS across all games, not per-game averages
    - fg_percentage and ft_percentage are calculated from totals (fgm/fga, ftm/fta)
    - Percentages are returned as decimals (e.g., 0.456 = 45.6%)
    - The list contains one entry per team with their complete shooting profile
