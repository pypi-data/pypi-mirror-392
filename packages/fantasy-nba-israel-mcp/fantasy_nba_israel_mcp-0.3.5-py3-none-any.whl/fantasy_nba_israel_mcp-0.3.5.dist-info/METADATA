# Fantasy NBA Israel League MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for accessing our Fantasy NBA Israel League statistics and rankings.

## Description

This MCP server connects to a specific Fantasy NBA League API (Fantasy NBA Israel League) and provides tools to retrieve team rankings, player statistics, and detailed analytics.

**Note:** This server is configured for a specific private league and connects to its dedicated API endpoint. It is not a general-purpose tool for any Fantasy NBA league - it's designed specifically for our league's data structure and API.

## Features

- **Get Average League Rankings**: Retrieve team rankings with detailed statistics
  - Sort in ascending or descending order
  - Detailed stats per category (FG%, FT%, 3PM, AST, REB, STL, BLK, PTS, GP)
  - Total points and rank for each team
- **Get Teams**: Retrieve list of all teams in the league
- **Get Average Stats**: Get team statistics in a user-friendly format with stats mapped by category
  - Option to retrieve raw or normalized (0-1 scale) data
  - Includes games played (GP) for each team
- **Get Team Details**: Retrieve comprehensive details for a specific team
  - Team statistics (totals and averages)
  - Complete roster with player stats including minutes played
  - ESPN team page URL
  - Shot chart stats and ranking information
  - Category ranks across all statistical categories
- **Get All Players**: Retrieve all players in the league with comprehensive statistics
  - Includes minutes played and games played for each player
- **Get League Shots Stats**: Retrieve league-wide shooting statistics for all teams

## Prerequisites

Before using this MCP server, you'll need:

1. **`uv` or `uvx`**: A fast Python package installer and runner
   - Install from [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
   - On macOS/Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
   - On Windows: `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

2. **An MCP-compatible client**: Choose one of the following or similar:
   - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) - AI assistant with MCP support
   - [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - AI-powered code editor
   - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
   - [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) - VSCode extension for AI assistance
   - Any other MCP-compatible application

## Usage

### As an MCP Server

This server works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cline, VSCode with GitHub Copilot Chat, etc.). Add the following configuration to your client's MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fantasynbaleague": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["fantasy-nba-israel-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Common configuration file locations:**
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows)
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or global settings
- **Cline**: Use the MCP settings UI or edit `cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **VSCode**: `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace

### Local Development

For local development and testing, you can run the MCP server in development mode:

```bash
uv run mcp dev fantasy_nba_israel_mcp/server.py
```

This will start an interactive MCP inspector where you can test your tools.

### Standalone Testing

```python
from fantasy_nba_israel_mcp import mcp

# Run the MCP server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Or run directly:

```bash
python -m fantasy_nba_israel_mcp
```
