1.3.0 (2025-01-XX)
------------------

* Added ``pretokenizer_2d`` module for pre-tokenization of patches with sequence model support (2D).
* New functions: ``tokenize_patch()`` and ``build_sequence_pair()`` for converting patches
  into token sequences with overlap information.
* Optimized batch processing with numba JIT compilation and parallel execution.
* Supports both single patches and batched processing for efficient training workflows.
* Designed for self-supervised learning, contrastive learning, and transformer-based models.

1.2.0 (2025-11-13)
------------------

* Added optional rotation-aware extraction for 2D patch pairs with matching overlap handling.
* Expanded tests and documentation to cover rotated patch workflows.

1.1.0 (2025-11-12)
------------------

* Restored Numba acceleration for 2D quilting via color-based parallel stitching that avoids write races.
* Expanded 3D patch-pair sampling tests to cover edge cases and fallback logic, driving coverage to 100%.
* Updated documentation to describe partially overlapping patch-pair utilities.
* Noted that NCZYXQuilt and the Large* variants still need analogous race-free acceleration.
