🧵 PyStringLite

A lightweight educational Python library that re-implements some of the most commonly used built-in string methods — manually, without using Python's internal string functions.

⚡ Great for learning how core string functions work under the hood!
📦 Available on PyPI (soon)

✨ Features

✅ Capitalization (capitalize)
✅ Counting substrings (count)
✅ Checking character types (isdigit, islower, isupper)
✅ Find & Index (find, index)
✅ Replace occurrences (replace)
✅ Strip whitespace (lstrip, rstrip)
✅ Split string from right (rsplit)
✅ Swap case (swapcase)

All functions are implemented using basic Python logic (loops, ASCII checks, slicing) — no shortcuts using built-ins.

🚀 Installation

Once you upload to PyPI, users will install with:
```bash
pip install funcLibrary
```

📚 Usage Example
```python


import funcLibrary.string_methods as psl

print(psl.capitalize("hello"))           # Hello
print(psl.count("lo", "hello world"))    # 1
print(psl.endswith("world", "hello world"))  # True
print(psl.find("lo", "hello"))           # 3
print(psl.isdigit("12345"))              # True
print(psl.islower("hello"))              # True
print(psl.isupper("HELLO"))              # True
print(psl.replace("lo", "L0", "hello", 1)) # heL0o
print(psl.rstrip("hello   "))            # "hello"
print(psl.lstrip("   hello"))            # "hello"
print(psl.swapcase("Hello"))             # hELLO
```
🎯 Why This Library?

Python's built-in string methods are optimized and complex inside CPython.
This project:

🔍 Helps you understand string manipulation logic
🎓 Serves as a learning tool for new developers
💡 Shows how things work “behind the scenes”

🔬 Benchmarks

These functions are not meant to replace Python’s built-ins for performance — this is an educational project.

But hey, you're free to benchmark and compare 😉

You already imported perf_counter — maybe later add a bench.py to compare your
