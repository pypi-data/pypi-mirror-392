Create a complete story outline for a {num_pages}-page illustrated children's book.

Title: "{title}"
Child's name: {child_name}, age {child_age}
Language: {language}
Theme: {summary}
Tone: warm, sparkling with wonder, optimistic, age-appropriate, with gentle humor.

Requirements:
1. The outline must contain a character introduction first, that briefly presents the main characters, their initial roles, and any gentle, age-appropriate perceptions or assumptions {child_name} might have about them. Do NOT state the moral of the story directly in this section; it should emerge naturally through the narrative. Follow this with exactly {num_pages} bullet points — one per page.
2. Each bullet point must be concise, ideally 2-4 sentences max, acting as a brief snapshot for an illustrated page, not a dense narrative. Within each bullet:
   - Describe the *single, most important* action or visual scene for that page, using vivid, age-appropriate, and concrete language to paint a clear picture suitable for a primary illustration.
   - Clearly show {child_name}'s age-appropriate goals, simple motivations, and a singular, evolving internal or external challenge for that page. This challenge should gently prompt {child_name} to make a clear, age-appropriate choice or take a small, brave step, explicitly showing their growth and agency. Highlight their emotional growth or shifting perspective through their choices, actions, and simple thoughts, ensuring each step of their transformation is easy for a child to grasp and unfolds gradually across pages.
   - Focus on *one primary, simple, and relatable* emotional beat for the page (e.g., gentle curiosity, blooming joy, slight apprehension, quiet determination). Ensure these emotions build and shift *slowly and naturally across pages*, allowing the young reader to fully experience and understand each feeling without being rushed. If introducing a moment of gentle apprehension, allow sufficient space for {child_name}'s deliberate shift towards courage or curiosity.
   - End with an irresistible hook for the next page, sparking eager anticipation or a delightful new discovery, consistently escalating wonder or gentle tension (except the last).
3. Include recurring characters and consistent locations. Ensure all key recurring characters have distinct, active roles and motivations, contributing meaningfully to the story's progression and {child_name}'s journey, rather than being passive observers.
4. Crucially, use *only* simple, concrete vocabulary and concepts suitable for a {child_age}-year-old. Ensure all descriptions, character thoughts, and emotional beats are *immediately* comprehensible and *directly* relatable, avoiding any abstract or complex language, even when describing internal states. The language used in the outline *itself* must reflect the target age and be easy to read for an adult reviewing it for a young child.
5. Make {child_name} the hero of the story.
6. Infuse the story with *exceptionally original* and *truly imaginative* discoveries, *playful* humor, and *inventive* magical realism, actively challenging and moving beyond overly common or predictable children's story tropes to achieve true novelty and spark genuine wonder. This might involve twisting familiar elements in unforeseen ways, introducing entirely new, delightful concepts, or gently subverting initial perceptions or age-appropriate assumptions held by {child_name} or the reader, leading to a surprising and heartwarming discovery.
7. Ensure each page presents *only one very simple, distinct step* in the narrative or hero's journey. Transitions must be incredibly smooth, maintaining a gentle, unhurried pace suitable for young children, allowing ample space for a large illustration and minimal accompanying text on each physical page. Avoid cramming multiple events, complex ideas, or rapid emotional shifts into a single page outline.
8. Keep the story structure simple:
   - Page 1–2: introduction & setup
   - Page 3–{last_adventure_page}: engaging adventure with rich, age-appropriate internal and external challenges that {child_name} actively navigates through their choices, leading to meaningful discoveries that prompt rich character interaction and clearly demonstrate the hero's evolving perspective or abilities.
   - Final 1–2 pages: heartwarming resolution, deeply satisfying emotional ending that clearly showcases {child_name}'s transformation and allows the valuable lesson to *emerge clearly* through their actions and the story's outcome, rather than being explicitly stated.
