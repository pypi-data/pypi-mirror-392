class FakeGitOps(GitOps):
    """In-memory fake implementation of git operations.

    State Management:
    -----------------
    This fake maintains mutable state to simulate git's stateful behavior.
    Operations like add_worktree, checkout_branch modify internal state.
    State changes are visible to subsequent method calls within the same test.

    When to Use Mutation:
    --------------------
    - Operations that simulate stateful external systems (git, databases)
    - When tests need to verify sequences of operations
    - When simulating side effects visible to production code

    Constructor Injection:
    ---------------------
    All INITIAL state is provided via constructor (immutable after construction).
    Runtime mutations occur through operation methods.
    Tests should construct fakes with complete initial state.

    Mutation Tracking:
    -----------------
    This fake tracks mutations for test assertions via read-only properties:
    - deleted_branches: Branches deleted via delete_branch_with_graphite()
    - added_worktrees: Worktrees added via add_worktree()
    - removed_worktrees: Worktrees removed via remove_worktree()
    - checked_out_branches: Branches checked out via checkout_branch()

    Examples:
    ---------
        # Initial state via constructor
        git_ops = FakeGitOps(
            worktrees={repo: [WorktreeInfo(path=wt1, branch="main")]},
            current_branches={wt1: "main"},
            git_common_dirs={repo: repo / ".git"},
        )

        # Mutation through operation
        git_ops.add_worktree(repo, wt2, branch="feature")

        # Verify mutation
        assert len(git_ops.list_worktrees(repo)) == 2
        assert (wt2, "feature") in git_ops.added_worktrees

        # Verify sequence of operations
        git_ops.checkout_branch(repo, "feature")
        git_ops.delete_branch_with_graphite(repo, "old-feature", force=True)

        assert "old-feature" in git_ops.deleted_branches
