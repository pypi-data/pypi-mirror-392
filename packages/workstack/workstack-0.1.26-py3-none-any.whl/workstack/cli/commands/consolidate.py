    """Consolidate stack branches into a single worktree.

    By default, consolidates full stack (trunk to leaf). With --down, consolidates
    only downstack branches (trunk to current).

    This command removes other worktrees that contain branches from the stack,
    ensuring branches exist in only one worktree. This is useful before
    stack-wide operations like 'gt restack'.

    BRANCH: Optional branch name. If provided, consolidate only from trunk up to
    this branch (partial consolidation). Cannot be used with --down.

    \b
    Examples:
      # Consolidate full stack into current worktree (default)
      $ workstack consolidate

      # Consolidate only downstack (trunk to current)
      $ workstack consolidate --down

      # Consolidate trunk → feat-2 only (leaves feat-3+ in separate worktrees)
      $ workstack consolidate feat-2

      # Create new worktree "my-stack" and consolidate full stack into it
      $ workstack consolidate --name my-stack

      # Consolidate downstack into new worktree
      $ workstack consolidate --down --name my-partial

      # Preview changes without executing
      $ workstack consolidate --dry-run

      # Skip confirmation prompt
      $ workstack consolidate --force

    Safety checks:
    - Aborts if any worktree being consolidated has uncommitted changes
    - Preserves the current worktree (or creates new one with --name)
    - Shows preview before removal (unless --force)
    - Never removes root worktree
