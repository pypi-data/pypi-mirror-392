"""Abstraction for activation script writing operations.

This module provides ScriptResult, a self-documenting return type for commands that
generate shell activation scripts. The key insight is that ScriptResult knows how to
output itself correctly to the right stream (stdout vs stderr), preventing an entire
class of shell integration bugs.

## Output Routing Decision Tree

When you have a ScriptResult, choose the appropriate output method:

1. **Shell Integration (--script flag)**: Use `result.output_for_shell_integration()`
   - Routes to stdout via machine_output()
   - Handler parses stdout to get script path
   - Used by: create, jump, switch, consolidate, sync

2. **User Visibility (verbose mode)**: Use `result.output_path_for_user()`
   - Routes to stderr via user_output()
   - Rarely needed - most commands either use shell integration or don't output path
   - Use case: verbose mode showing where script was written

3. **Advanced (deferred output)**: Save result object, call method later
   - Save full `result` object, not just `result.path`
   - Call output method when ready
   - Used by: sync (conditional output based on worktree changes)

4. **Return to Caller**: Just return `result.path`
   - Use when caller needs the path for further processing
   - No output performed
   - Used by: prepare_cwd_recovery, handler helpers

## Usage Examples

### Immediate Output (Most Common)

```python
result = ctx.script_writer.write_activation_script(
    script_content,
    command_name="jump",
    comment="Jump to worktree",
)
result.output_for_shell_integration()
```

### Deferred Output (Conditional Logic)

```python
# Save result object for later
script_result = ctx.script_writer.write_activation_script(
    script_content,
    command_name="sync",
    comment="Return to worktree",
)

# ... more logic to decide if directory change is needed ...

if should_output:
    script_result.output_for_shell_integration()
```

### Return to Caller (No Output)

```python
result = ctx.script_writer.write_activation_script(
    script_content,
    command_name="prepare",
    comment="Prepare recovery",
)
return result.path  # Caller will handle output
```

## Migration from Old Pattern

**Old pattern (error-prone):**
```python
result = ctx.script_writer.write_activation_script(...)
machine_output(str(result.path), nl=False)  # Easy to use wrong function
```

**New pattern (self-documenting):**
```python
result = ctx.script_writer.write_activation_script(...)
result.output_for_shell_integration()  # Intent is obvious
```

## Why This Design Prevents Bugs

The old pattern had several problems:

1. **Type System Can't Help**: Both machine_output() and user_output() accept str
2. **Wrong Choice Fails Silently**: Handler shows "no directory change needed"
3. **Bug Manifests Elsewhere**: Error appears in handler.py, not command file
4. **Easy to Forget**: Developer must remember routing rule for each context

The new pattern solves all these problems:

1. **Self-Documenting API**: Method name makes intent obvious
2. **Type-Safe**: Can't accidentally route to wrong stream
3. **Idempotent**: Multiple calls safe (only outputs once)
4. **Fail Fast**: Errors in output routing stay local to command

## Implementation Details

- **Lazy Imports**: Methods import machine_output/user_output inside to avoid circular deps
- **Frozen Dataclass**: Uses object.__setattr__() for idempotency flag
- **No Trailing Newline**: Handler expects stdout without trailing newline (nl=False)
