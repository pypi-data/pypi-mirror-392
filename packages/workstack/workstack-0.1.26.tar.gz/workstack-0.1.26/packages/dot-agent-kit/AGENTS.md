## Quick Reference

### Important Terminology

Before exploring the codebase or making changes, familiarize yourself with these core concepts (see [GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md) for full definitions):

- **Artifact**: A Claude Code extension file (skill, command, agent, hook, or doc)
- **Kit**: A packaged collection of related artifacts
- **MANAGED**: Artifact installed from a kit, tracked in `dot-agent.toml`
- **LOCAL**: Artifact created manually, not associated with a kit
- **Level**: USER (`~/.claude/`) or PROJECT (`./.claude/`)

### When to Consult the Glossary

Check [docs/GLOSSARY.md](docs/GLOSSARY.md) when you need to:

- Understand the difference between MANAGED and LOCAL artifacts
- Learn about the data models (InstalledArtifact, ArtifactSource, etc.)
- See examples of common filtering and query patterns
- Understand the structure of `dot-agent.toml`

This prevents the need to explore the codebase just to understand basic terminology.
