# Article Ideas

Topics to explore in agentic programming articles.

## Ideas

1. **The unreasonable effectiveness of fakes** - How using in-memory fakes instead of mocks transforms testing and enables agentic development workflows

2. **Devrun for diagnostic tools to swallow context** - Using specialized agents to run diagnostic tools (pytest, pyright, ruff) while keeping large outputs isolated from the main conversation context

3. **Everything's a multi-agent workflow for planning is essential** - Why breaking down complex tasks into specialized agent workflows is fundamental to successful agentic programming

4. **Parallel execution of worktrees** - Leveraging git worktrees to run multiple feature branches in parallel, enabling true concurrent development workflows

5. **Using a tool like Wispr Flow to talk to Claude Code** - Voice-to-text workflows for hands-free agentic programming and natural conversation with AI assistants

6. **Using hooks to inject guidance that Claude Code will actually follow** - How to configure prompt submission hooks to enforce coding standards and inject context that agents consistently respect

7. **Packaged run commands in .agent** - Using `.agent/` directory to bundle execution scripts alongside skills and commands, creating portable agent toolkits

8. **Planning workflow with workstack enrichment** - How to plan implementations, create worktrees from plans, and customize the enrichment step to inject project-specific context before autonomous execution

9. **Always run Claude in verbose mode** - Why enabling verbose output is essential for understanding agent reasoning, debugging workflows, and building trust in agentic development

10. **Be conversant with software engineering jargon - agents love it** - How using precise technical terminology improves agent comprehension, reduces ambiguity, and leads to better code generation

11. **Skills are new, but they are almost always better than MCPs for local development** - Why Claude Code skills provide a more lightweight and effective approach than MCP servers for project-specific tooling and workflows

12. **Think of yourself as a token factory** - Understanding token economics in agentic workflows: optimizing context usage, minimizing waste, and designing systems that scale with token constraints

13. **Get started by using Claude for read-only tasks** - Build trust with agentic programming by starting with low-risk operations: searching logs, analyzing commit histories, running git blame, and distilling large amounts of context for human consumption

14. **Fast tests and high-quality error messages have never been so important** - How agent-driven development amplifies the value of instant feedback loops and clear diagnostic messages for rapid iteration and debugging

15. **Merge conflict resolution through thesis reapplication** - How to resolve merge conflicts by having agents re-apply the original thesis or intent of changes rather than mechanically merging line-level diffs

16. **Worktrees are just a view** - Understanding git worktrees as filesystem projections of branches rather than heavyweight copies, demystifying how they enable parallel development without repository duplication

17. **Ctrl-G is your friend** - How using Ctrl-G to interrupt and redirect agents mid-execution prevents wasted tokens, enables course correction, and creates a more collaborative development flow

18. **Compaction Considered Harmful** - Why automatically compacting conversation history destroys crucial context, breaks agent reasoning chains, and how to design workflows that preserve the full conversational thread
