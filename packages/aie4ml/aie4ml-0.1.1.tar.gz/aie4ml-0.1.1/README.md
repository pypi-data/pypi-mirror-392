`aie4ml` (to be published soon) is a plugin backend for [`hls4ml`](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml) that targets the **AMD AI Engine (AIE)**.  `aie4ml` generates **ready-to-compile AIE projects** that can be built directly using **AMD Vitis**.

- Supports linear (dense) layers, with optional bias and ReLU activation
- Produces optimized implementations that can automatically scale across the AIE array
- Offers much shorter compilation/synthesis times compared to traditional FPGA HLS flows
- Enables high throughput especially for large models
- Currently supports Gen2 architecture devices (AIE-ML) with plans for broader support in the future.


# Frontend Compatibility

Operates on the intermediate model representation produced by hls4ml, therefore independent of the frontend (i.e., PyTorch, QKeras, etc.).

# Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml.git@main
pip install aie4ml
```
