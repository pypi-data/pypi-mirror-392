## ⚠️ Important Notice

**This repository contains a SIMPLIFIED, PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION of CandorFlow concepts.**

This is NOT the full proprietary system. Many advanced features, algorithms, and optimizations are intentionally excluded. See [What Is NOT Included](#what-is-not-included-proprietary) for details.

---

## 📖 Overview

CandorFlow is a training stability monitoring and intervention system designed to detect and prevent neural network training instabilities before they cause divergence.

This public repository demonstrates:
- A simplified stability metric **λ(t)** based on gradient variance
- Basic threshold-based monitoring
- Automatic checkpoint rollback on instability detection
- Learning rate reduction for recovery
- Minimal working examples with toy models

### What is λ(t)?

The lambda metric **λ(t)** is a stability indicator that tracks training health over time. In this simplified demo, it measures gradient norm variance as a proxy for instability.

**High λ(t) → Training is becoming unstable**  
**Low λ(t) → Training is stable**

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Option 1: Install from GitHub (Recommended)

Install CandorFlow directly from the repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CandorSystem/CandorFlow.git
```

After installation, you can import CandorFlow from anywhere:

```python
from candorflow import compute_lambda, StabilityController
from candorflow.demo import run_demo, plot_results
```

### Option 2: Development Installation

For contributing, modifying the code, or running examples from the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CandorSystem/CandorFlow.git
cd CandorFlow
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package in editable mode, so changes to the source code are immediately reflected.

### Option 3: Manual Setup (Not Recommended)

If you prefer not to install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CandorSystem/CandorFlow.git
cd CandorFlow
pip install -r requirements.txt
python examples/run_demo.py  # Must run from repo directory
```

**Note:** With this approach, you'll need to add the repository to your Python path or run scripts from the repository root directory.

---

## 💻 Usage

### Quick Start: Run the Training Demo

After installation, run the demo:

```python
from candorflow.demo import run_demo, plot_results

# Run the demo
results = run_demo()

# Generate plots
plot_results(results)
```

Or use the command-line wrapper:

```bash
python examples/run_demo.py
```

This will:
1. Create a small MLP neural network
2. Train it on synthetic data
3. Compute λ(t) at each step
4. Inject synthetic instability spike at step 30
5. Demonstrate automatic detection and rollback
6. Generate two plots:
   - `plots/lambda_curve.png` - λ(t) over time with intervention markers
   - `plots/stability_phases.png` - Color-coded stability zones

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Saved plots to plots/
  - lambda_curve.png
  - stability_phases.png
```

### Colab Integration

The demo is designed for easy Colab integration:

```python
!pip install candorflow

from candorflow.demo import run_demo, plot_results
results = run_demo(steps=50, spike_step=30, threshold=2.0)
plot_results(results)
```

All training logic is contained in `candorflow.demo` - no need to write training loops in Colab!

## 🔬 How It Works (Simplified Version)

### 1. Monitor Training with λ(t)

```python
from candorflow import compute_lambda, StabilityController

# During training loop
lambda_value = compute_lambda(
    model=model,
    loss=loss,
    gradient_history=gradient_history
)
```

### 2. Automatic Intervention

```python
controller = StabilityController(threshold=2.0)

action = controller.update(
    lambda_value=lambda_value,
    model=model,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    step=step
)

if action["action"] == "rollback":
    print("Instability detected - rolling back to stable checkpoint")
```

### 3. Training Continues Safely

The controller automatically:
- Saves checkpoints when training is stable
- Detects when λ(t) exceeds threshold
- Rolls back to last stable state
- Reduces learning rate
- Resumes training

---

## 📊 Example Results

After running the demo, you'll see plots like this:

**Lambda Curve with Interventions:**
- Blue line: λ(t) stability metric over time
- Purple dashed line: Instability threshold
- Orange markers: Rollback + LR reduction events
- Red markers: Warnings

**Stability Phases:**
- Green zone: Stable training
- Orange zone: Warning (approaching threshold)
- Red zone: Unstable (intervention triggered)

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

The demo includes built-in validation:

```bash
# Run training demo (includes self-checks)
python examples/demo_training_loop.py

# Generate plots (validates results)
python examples/demo_plots.py
```
