GroundingDINO Compatibility Shim

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
This package is now provided by GroundedDINO-VL. The 'groundingdino' namespace
is maintained for backward compatibility only.

For new code, please use:
    import groundeddino_vl
    from groundeddino_vl.models import build_model
    from groundeddino_vl.utils import inference

This compatibility layer will be maintained for the foreseeable future,
but new features will only be added to the groundeddino_vl package.
