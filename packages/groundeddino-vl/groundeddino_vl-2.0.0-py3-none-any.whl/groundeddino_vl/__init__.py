GroundedDINO-VL - Modern Vision-Language Foundation Models

A refactored and modernized framework based on GroundingDINO,
optimized for PyTorch 2.7+ and CUDA 12.x.

Quick Start:
    >>> from groundeddino_vl import load_model, predict
    >>>
    >>> # Load a model
    >>> model = load_model("config.py", "weights.pth", device="cuda")
    >>>
    >>> # Run inference
    >>> result = predict(model, "image.jpg", "car . person . dog")
    >>>
    >>> # Access results
    >>> print(f"Found {len(result)} objects")
    >>> for label, score in zip(result.labels, result.scores):
    >>>     print(f"{label}: {score:.2f}")

Public API:
    Core Functions:
        - load_model: Load a model from config and checkpoint
        - predict: Run object detection with text prompts
        - load_image: Load and preprocess an image
        - preprocess_image: Preprocess an in-memory image
        - annotate: Draw detection results on an image

    Data Structures:
        - DetectionResult: Container for detection results

    Advanced:
        - models: Model architectures and builders (for advanced users)
        - utils: Inference utilities and helpers (for advanced users)
        - data: Data loading and transforms (for advanced users)
        - ops: CUDA operations (if available, for advanced users)
