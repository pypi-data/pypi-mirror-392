# **funnyreason**

A delightfully pointless Python package that spits out a random, ridiculous reason
for anything in life, coding, debugging, or your next existential spiral.

Because sometimes you don’t need logic — you just need an excuse.

---

## **📦 Install**

```bash
pip install funnyreason
```

---

## **🔥 Usage**

```python
from funnyreason import random_reason

print(random_reason())
```

Example output:

```
Because the universe was bored.
```

Or maybe:

```
A squirrel told me to.
```

Life is unpredictable. This package leans into that.

## **✨ What Is This?**

A micro-library with absolutely no practical purpose.
It doesn’t solve problems. It doesn’t optimize code.
It just gives you a funny reason, so you can blame something else.

Perfect for:

* Commit messages
* Slack chats
* Error logs
* Mood-boosting nonsense
* Impressing the neighbor’s cat

---

## **🛠️ Features**

* Zero configuration
* Zero philosophy
* Zero productivity boost
* 100% chaos-inspired reasons
