fstFlow makes it easy to build, compose, and work with finite state transducers in Python. Whether you're working on natural language processing, text transformation, or other FST-based applications, fstFlow provides an intuitive API and powerful abstractions.

## Features

- **Simple FST Creation**: Straightforward API to define and build finite state transducers
- **Composition**: Easily compose multiple FSTs together
- **Flexible Operations**: Support for various FST operations and transformations
- **Pythonic Design**: Natural Python syntax and conventions

## Installation

```bash
pip install fstflow
```

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** - fstFlow is actively being developed. The API is subject to change.
