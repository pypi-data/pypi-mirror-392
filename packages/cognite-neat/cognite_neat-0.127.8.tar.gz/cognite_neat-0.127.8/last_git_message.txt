[😄] Allow warning severity (#1448)

# Description

Warning is things like changing an index or constraint. I think we
should allow users to do these changes, even when they are in additive
mode.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Improved
- [alpha - v1] Neat now allows you to deploy with a warning severity.
