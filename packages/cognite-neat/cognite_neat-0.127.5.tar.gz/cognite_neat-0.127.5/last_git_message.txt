[THIS-865] 📊Allow updating index and constraints (#1445)

# Description

To achieve modifying indexes and constraints I do 2 steps.

1. I update the plan step in the SchemaDeployer to change modified
index/constrains as a removal + addition,

2. I update the consolidate plan to not consolidate removals if they are
additions for index/constraints,
