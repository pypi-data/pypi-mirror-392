# Stichotrope

> **In Development** - v0.2.0 with verified performance characteristics

A Python profiling library for deterministic function and block-level profiling.

## Overview

Stichotrope is a native Python equivalent of CppProfiler, offering:

- **Block-level profiling**: Fills the gap between function-level and line-level profiling
- **Multi-track organization**: Logical grouping of profiling data
- **Explicit instrumentation**: Decorators and context managers for precise control
- **Thread-safe profiling**: Built-in support for multi-threaded applications
- **Low overhead**: ≤1% overhead for functions ≥1ms (verified)
- **Deterministic profiling**: Predictable, reproducible performance measurements

## Project Status

🔄 **Phase 2 - Core Architecture** - Milestone 2.1 Complete

This project is actively being developed following a structured roadmap toward v1.0.0. Completed:

- ✅ Testing framework and performance baseline
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Thread-safe architecture (v0.2.0)
- ✅ Core profiler implementation with verified performance
- 🔄 Documentation infrastructure
- ⏳ PyPI packaging setup
- ⏳ Configuration system
- ⏳ Production features

## Planned Features

- Thread-safe profiling for multi-threaded applications
- TOML-based configuration system
- CSV/JSON export (CppProfiler-compatible)
- Statistical benchmarking with confidence intervals
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Python 3.9-3.12 support

## Installation

**Not yet available on PyPI**

Once released, installation will be:

```bash
pip install stichotrope
```

## Quick Start

**Coming soon** - The library is not yet ready for use.

Example usage (planned):

```python
from stichotrope import Profiler

profiler = Profiler("MyApp")

@profiler.track(0, "process_data")
def process_data(data):
    return transform(data)

def complex_function():
    with profiler.block(1, "database_query"):
        result = query_database()
    return result
```

## Documentation

Documentation will be available at [Read the Docs](https://stichotrope.readthedocs.io) once the project reaches a stable release.

## Development

This project follows a milestone-based development workflow with strict quality gates. See the [roadmap](__design__/02-product_roadmap_v2.md) for detailed planning.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome once the project reaches v1.0.0. For now, development is focused on establishing the core infrastructure and architecture.
