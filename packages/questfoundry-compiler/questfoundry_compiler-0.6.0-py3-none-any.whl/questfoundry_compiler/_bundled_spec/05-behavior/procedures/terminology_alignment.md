# Terminology Alignment

## Purpose

Ensure consistent term usage across all surfaces (manuscript, codex, PN phrasing, captions, translations) through coordination with Style Lead and Translator, maintaining a bilingual glossary as authoritative reference.

## Core Principles

- **Consistency**: Same term used consistently across all contexts
- **Coordination**: Style Lead, Translator, and PN all use aligned terms
- **Bilingual Support**: Glossary tracks both source and target languages
- **Living Document**: Glossary evolves as terminology stabilizes
- **No Prescription**: Supply terminology without forcing translation solutions

## Steps

1. **Identify Terms**: Catalog terms requiring standardization
   - World-specific vocabulary (in-universe terms)
   - Technical/specialized language
   - Character names and titles
   - Place names
   - Cultural concepts
   - Terms used in gates or choices

2. **Create Glossary Entries**: Document each term
   - **Source Term**: Primary language term (canonical form)
   - **Definition**: Brief, player-safe explanation
   - **Context**: Where/how it's used
   - **Variants**: Acceptable alternate forms
   - **Target Language Terms**: Translations (if applicable)
   - **Register Notes**: Formality, tone considerations
   - **Portability Notes**: Cultural adaptation concerns

3. **Coordinate with Style Lead**: Align phrasing
   - Review terms for register consistency
   - Confirm which variants are acceptable
   - Identify banned forms or phrasings
   - Ensure PN phrasing patterns use glossary terms

4. **Coordinate with Translator**: Align translations
   - Share glossary with target-language terms
   - Note cultural portability issues
   - Document idiomatic challenges
   - Accept feedback on translation options
   - Keep bilingual glossary updated

5. **Coordinate with Scene Smith & PN**: Ensure adoption
   - Share glossary slice for manuscript use
   - Provide PN phrasing examples using standard terms
   - Flag manuscript sections using non-standard variants
   - Coordinate caption terminology (via Art/Audio Directors)

6. **Resolve Conflicts**: Handle terminology disputes
   - When multiple terms exist for same concept
   - Coordinate with Style Lead for creative decisions
   - Document rationale for chosen form
   - Update glossary with decision

7. **Track Adoption**: Monitor usage across surfaces
   - Audit manuscript for non-standard variants
   - Check codex entries for consistency
   - Review PN phrasing patterns
   - Verify caption/alt text alignment
   - Flag deviations for correction

8. **Maintain Glossary**: Keep current and accessible
   - Add new terms as they emerge
   - Update translations as they stabilize
   - Remove deprecated variants
   - Version control for traceability

## Outputs

- **Bilingual Glossary**: Authoritative term list with:
  - Source language terms (canonical forms)
  - Definitions (player-safe)
  - Context and usage notes
  - Acceptable variants
  - Target language translations
  - Register and portability notes
- **Glossary Slices**: Targeted term lists for specific roles
  - Scene Smith: manuscript terminology
  - PN: phrasing patterns
  - Translator: translation pairs
  - Art/Audio Directors: caption terminology
- **Terminology Reports**: Adoption tracking and conflict resolution
- **Coordination Notes**: Records of Style/Translator alignment

## Quality Checks

- Glossary contains all key terms used across surfaces
- Definitions player-safe (no spoilers or internals)
- Target language translations present (if multilingual project)
- Variants documented and bounded
- Register notes align with Style Lead guidance
- Portability concerns flagged for Translator
- Adoption tracked across manuscript, codex, PN, captions
- Conflicts resolved and rationale documented
- Glossary accessible to all roles needing terminology
- Regular audits catch non-standard usage
