# Diegetic Gate Language Procedure

## Overview

Transform mechanical gateway conditions into player-facing, in-world language that maintains immersion and hides internal logic.

## Steps

### Step 1: Condition Translation

Convert technical gateway logic (e.g., `has_sword && trust>5`) into diegetic descriptions.

### Step 2: Hint Crafting

Create subtle environmental or narrative cues that telegraph requirements without exposition.

### Step 3: Failure Messaging

Write in-world explanations for why a path is unavailable (not "you don't meet requirements").

### Step 4: Success Integration

Ensure gateway passages feel natural, not arbitrary or mechanical.

### Step 5: Style Alignment

Coordinate with Style Lead for voice consistency in gate descriptions.

## Output

Diegetic gateway language that preserves immersion and player discovery.
