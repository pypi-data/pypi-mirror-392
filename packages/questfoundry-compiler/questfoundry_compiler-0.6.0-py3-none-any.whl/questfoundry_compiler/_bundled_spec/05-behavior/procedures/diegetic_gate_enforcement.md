# Diegetic Gate Enforcement Procedure

## Overview

Test and validate that all gateway implementations maintain diegesis, avoid mechanical language, and support player understanding.

## Steps

### Step 1: Gateway Audit

Review all gateway conditions for presentation violations.

### Step 2: Playtest Dry Run

Perform Player-Narrator simulation to experience gates from player perspective.

### Step 3: Violation Detection

Flag any mechanical language, unclear requirements, or immersion breaks.

### Step 4: Clarity Assessment

Ensure players can reasonably infer what gates require without metagaming.

### Step 5: Remediation Coordination

Work with Style Lead to rephrase violations maintaining diegesis.

## Output

Gatekeeper validation report certifying diegetic gateway compliance.
