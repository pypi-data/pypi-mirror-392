# Illustration Slot Selection

## Purpose

Choose image moments that clarify, recall, signal, or enrich mood—and specify them in player-safe plans that respect style and accessibility.

## Core Principles

- **Purpose-Driven Selection**: Each slot must serve one or more clear purposes:
  - **Clarify**: Aid comprehension of complex concepts or settings
  - **Recall**: Remind players of prior events or characters
  - **Mood**: Enhance emotional atmosphere
  - **Signpost**: Mark important narrative moments or transitions

- **Material Aid**: Only select slots where imagery materially aids player experience; avoid decorative-only images

- **Player-Safe**: All selections must respect spoiler hygiene and presentation boundaries

## Steps

1. **Review Content**: Examine manuscript sections, codex entries, and scene briefs
2. **Identify Candidates**: Mark moments where visual aid would enhance player experience
3. **State Purpose**: For each candidate, explicitly identify which purpose(s) it serves
4. **Prioritize Impact**: Choose slots with highest material benefit to comprehension
5. **Coordinate with Style**: Ensure selections align with visual motif palette and register
6. **Document in Shotlist**: Record planned slots with purpose, owner, and status

## Outputs

- **Art Slot Requests**: Identified moments requiring illustration
- **Shotlist Updates**: Ordered list of slots with purposes and priorities
- **Coordination Hooks**: Requests to Curator, Style, or Plotwright for supporting elements

## Quality Checks

- Each selected slot has clear, stated purpose
- Selections avoid spoiler telegraph or mechanic exposure
- Visual choices support diegetic gates, never explain them
- Shotlist maintains traceability to source content
