# Player-Safe Encyclopedia

## Purpose

Explain just enough of the world for players to act with confidence—clearly, concisely, and without spoilers—through structured encyclopedia entries.

## Core Principles

- **Spoiler Hygiene**: Never include twist causality, secret allegiances, or gate logic
- **Structured Clarity**: Consistent entry format aids comprehension
- **Player-Safe Only**: All entry content safe for player consumption
- **Support Action**: Enable confident decision-making without revealing outcomes
- **Accessibility**: Descriptive headings, simple sentences, clear language

## Entry Structure

All codex entries follow this structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief definition (1-2 sentences)
2. **Usage**: How this concept/object/term is used in-world
3. **Context**: Where/when it appears; relevant background
4. **See also**: Crosslinks to related entries
5. **Notes**: Additional clarifications (optional)
6. **Lineage**: Source traceability (TU IDs, player-safe summaries)

## Steps

1. **Draft Overview**: Write concise definition
   - 1-2 sentences maximum
   - Plain language, avoid jargon
   - Define what it is, not internal mechanics

2. **Explain Usage**: Describe in-world application
   - What characters do with this
   - How it functions in the story
   - Practical player knowledge
   - No spoiler outcomes or hidden purposes

3. **Provide Context**: Supply relevant background
   - Where/when it appears
   - Cultural/historical notes (if applicable)
   - Connection to story world
   - Keep neutral—no foreshadowing

4. **Add Crosslinks**: Link to related entries
   - "See also" list of related concepts
   - Descriptive link text (not "click here")
   - Support exploration without forcing sequence

5. **Include Notes** (if needed): Clarifications or caveats
   - Edge cases or variants
   - Common misconceptions to avoid
   - Still player-safe—no spoilers

6. **Document Lineage**: Track source
   - TU IDs that informed this entry
   - Player-safe summary of source
   - Lore Weaver summaries referenced
   - Traceability for future updates

7. **Review Against Criteria**:
   - No twist causality or secret causes
   - No gate logic or internal checks exposed
   - Terms align with Curator glossary
   - Accessible language (simple sentences, descriptive headings)
   - Descriptive link text throughout

## Outputs

- **Codex Entry**: Structured encyclopedia entry following format
- **Crosslink Additions**: Updates to related entries' "See also" sections
- **Glossary Update**: Terms added to terminology list
- **Lineage Documentation**: TU and source traceability

## Quality Checks

- Entry follows standard structure (Overview → Usage → Context → See also → Notes → Lineage)
- No spoilers anywhere (twist causes, secret allegiances, gate logic)
- Terminology aligns with Curator's glossary
- Crosslinks all resolve and use descriptive text
- Language accessible (simple sentences, clear headings)
- Entry enables confident action without revealing outcomes
- Lineage complete for future reference
- No internal labels or codeword names
