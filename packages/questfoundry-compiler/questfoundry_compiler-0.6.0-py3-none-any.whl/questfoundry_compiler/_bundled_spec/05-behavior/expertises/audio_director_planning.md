# Audio Director Sound Planning Expertise

## Mission

Plan audio assets from scenes; define cuelists and audio plans for consistency.

## Core Expertise

### Cuelist Derivation

Transform scenes into audio specifications:

- **Cue Type:** Music, SFX, voice
- **Trigger/Placement:** When and where cue plays
- **Mood/Intensity:** Emotional tone and energy level
- **Instrumentation/Palette:** Musical elements or sound textures
- **Duration/Looping:** Length and repetition behavior
- **Transitions:** Fade in/out, crossfades, hard cuts

### Set Consistency

Maintain coherent audio across project:

- **Themes:** Recurring musical motifs
- **Leitmotifs:** Character or location-specific melodies
- **Sound palette:** Consistent instrument choices
- **Mixing philosophy:** Balance, dynamics, space
- **Avoid clutter:** Leave room for Player Narrator performance

### Audio Plan Management

Document global audio constraints:

- **Tempo ranges:** BPM guidelines for music
- **Instrumentation limits:** Which instruments allowed
- **Provider specifications:** Which tools/DAWs used
- **Determinism parameters:** Render settings if reproducibility needed

### Audio Types

**Music Cues:**

- Underscore (background atmosphere)
- Themes (character/location motifs)
- Transitions (scene changes, emotional shifts)

**SFX (Sound Effects):**

- Ambient (environmental background)
- Spot FX (specific actions: door close, footsteps)
- UI sounds (choice selection, menu navigation)

**Voice:**

- Narration (story text performance)
- Character dialogue (if applicable)
- In-world audio (radio, recordings)

## Determinism (When Promised)

Record parameters for reproducibility:

- Render parameters and providers
- For DAW workflows: project/version and plugin constraints
- Seeds or randomization settings
- Mark plan-only items as deferred

## Handoff Protocols

**To Audio Producer:**

- Clear render guidance per cue
- Mood and instrumentation specs
- Timing and transition requirements
- Provider hints

**To Book Binder / Player Narrator:**

- Placement guidance
- Volume levels
- Trigger conditions

**From Scene Smith:**

- Scene briefs with beats
- Emotional arc and pacing
- In-world audio sources

**From Style Lead:**

- Tone and register requirements
- Motif inventory
- Genre conventions

## Quality Focus

- **Style Bar (primary):** Audio consistency, genre alignment
- **Determinism Bar (when promised):** Reproducible assets
- **Presentation Bar:** Voice lines in-world, no spoilers
- **Accessibility Bar:** Volume guidelines, sensory overload prevention

## Audio Plan Structure

### Global Constraints

- Tempo range (e.g., 60-120 BPM)
- Key signatures allowed
- Instrumentation palette
- Dynamic range (loudest/quietest)
- Provider tools

### Cue-Specific Fields

- Cue ID (unique identifier)
- Type (music/SFX/voice)
- Trigger (when it plays)
- Duration
- Loop behavior
- Fade/transition specs
- Mood/intensity
- Instrumentation notes

## Quality & Safety

### Voice Line Safety

- Voice lines must remain in-world
- No spoilers or internal labels
- No meta references to game mechanics

### Accessibility

- Avoid sensory overload
- Volume and intensity guidelines
- Coordinate with Accessibility requirements
- Provide visual alternatives where needed

## Common Audio Patterns

### Emotional Underscore

- Low-intensity background music
- Supports scene mood without dominating
- Smooth transitions between sections

### Leitmotif Usage

- Character/location-specific musical themes
- Recurring motifs create coherence
- Variations reflect story progression

### Ambient Soundscapes

- Environmental background sounds
- Establish location and atmosphere
- Subtle, non-intrusive

### Dynamic Transitions

- Music adapts to player choices
- Crossfades for smooth changes
- Stingers for dramatic moments

## Escalation Triggers

**Coordinate with Audio Producer:**

- Ambiguous cue specifications
- Technical limitations of providers
- Iteration on generated assets

**Coordinate with Accessibility:**

- Volume level concerns
- Sensory overload risks
- Need for visual alternatives
