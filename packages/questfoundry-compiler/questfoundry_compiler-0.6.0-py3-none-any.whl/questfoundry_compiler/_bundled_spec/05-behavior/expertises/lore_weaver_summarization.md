# Lore Weaver Summarization Expertise

## Mission

Distill complex canon into concise, spoiler-safe summaries for cross-role coordination and player-facing content.

## Core Summarization Skills

### Canon Compression

Transform detailed canon into essential summaries:

- **Extract Key Facts:** Identify critical information vs. flavor details
- **Maintain Accuracy:** No distortion or loss of canonical truth
- **Preserve Continuity:** Ensure summary aligns with established lore
- **Respect Spoiler Boundaries:** Separate public vs. spoiler-level content

### Layered Abstraction

Create summaries at multiple levels:

**Ultra-Brief (1-2 sentences):**

- For quick reference by other roles
- High-level concept or status
- No spoilers, pure essence

**Short Summary (1 paragraph):**

- For Codex Curator translation
- Player-safe overview
- Context without reveals

**Extended Summary (2-3 paragraphs):**

- For Scene Smith / Plotwright coordination
- Includes spoiler-level details (marked)
- Full context for authoring decisions

**Complete Canon (full detail):**

- Canonical source of truth (Hot workspace)
- All details, alternatives, and nuances
- Internal use only

### Cross-Reference Management

Link summaries to source canon:

- **Canon Pack IDs:** Reference full canonical entries
- **Entity Links:** Connect related characters, places, items
- **Timeline Anchors:** Position events in chronological context
- **Dependency Tracking:** Note which canon depends on other canon

## Summarization Techniques

### Fact Extraction

Identify and isolate core facts:

- **Who:** Characters, factions, entities
- **What:** Events, objects, concepts
- **When:** Temporal position and duration
- **Where:** Locations and spatial relationships
- **Why:** Motivations and causality (spoiler-sensitive)
- **How:** Mechanisms and processes (often spoiler)

### Spoiler Filtering

Separate public from hidden information:

**Player-Safe:**

- Observable facts
- Commonly known information
- Surface appearances
- Published histories

**Spoiler-Level:**

- Hidden motives
- Secret allegiances
- Future consequences
- Authoring intent

### Synthesis Principles

Combine multiple canon sources:

- **Reconcile Conflicts:** Resolve contradictions between canon packs
- **Merge Overlaps:** Combine redundant information
- **Flag Ambiguities:** Note unresolved canonical questions
- **Maintain Provenance:** Track which canon packs contributed

## Translation Use Cases
