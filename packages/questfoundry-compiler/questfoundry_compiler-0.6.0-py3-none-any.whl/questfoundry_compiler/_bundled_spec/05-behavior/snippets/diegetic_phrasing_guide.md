# Diegetic Phrasing Guide

Use world-based language, not system mechanics.

## Gateway Phrasing

**Meta (forbidden):**

- "You need flag_approved == true to proceed"
- "This choice requires state.trust >= 5"
- "If you have the key item, you can unlock this"

**Diegetic (correct):**

- "The guard eyes your dock pass. With the foreman's stamp, he waves you through."
- "She meets your gaze. Trust earned, she speaks freely."
- "The door is locked. Perhaps someone in town has the key."

## Choice Text

**Meta (forbidden):**

- "Select option 1 to gain the key"
- "Click here to proceed"
- "Choose wisely (this affects the ending)"

**Diegetic (correct):**

- "Ask the guard about the locked door"
- "Confront Kestrel about the documents"
- "Leave through the back entrance"

## State Changes

**Meta (forbidden):**

- "Trust level increased to 5"
- "Flag_betrayal set to true"
- "Unlocked romance path"

**Diegetic (correct):**

- "Kestrel's expression softens slightly"
- "You notice her hand moves to her weapon"
- "She smiles, perhaps for the first time"

## Narration

**Meta (forbidden):**

- "This is a critical story beat"
- "This section has a gateway check"
- "You previously selected option B"

**Diegetic (correct):**

- [Just present the scene naturally]
- [Show the obstacle through narration]
- [Reflect prior choices through world state]

**Technique:** Show consequences through world changes, character reactions, and environmental details—never through meta-commentary.
