# Spoiler Hygiene

## Core Principle

Player-facing surfaces must NEVER reveal behind-the-scenes information that would spoil narrative discovery or break immersion.

## Forbidden on Player Surfaces

### Narrative Spoilers

- Twist causality or reveals
- Secret allegiances
- Hidden causes or motivations
- Foreshadowing via mechanics

### Technical Internals

- Codeword names (e.g., "OMEGA_CLEARANCE")
- Gate logic (e.g., "if FLAG_X then...")
- Internal labels or IDs
- Technique details:
  - Image generation seeds/models
  - DAW/plugin names
  - Audio processing details
  - AI model parameters

### Meta Language

- "Option locked"
- "You don't have FLAG_X"
- "Roll a check"
- "Quest not complete"

## Safe Alternatives

### Instead of Spoilers

- Use neutral summaries
- Defer entries until appropriate story moment
- Keep speculation in Hot comments

### Instead of Gate Logic

- Use diegetic cues ("badge missing," "scanner blinks red")
- In-world rationales without exposing mechanics
- Environmental obstacles

### Instead of Technique

- Store determinism logs OFF-SURFACE
- Use atmospheric captions ("Frost webs the viewport")
- Keep process notes in Hot-only documentation

## Application by Role

**Lore Weaver:**

- Canon Packs remain Hot ALWAYS
- Only player-safe summaries go to Codex Curator
- No twist causality in summaries

**Gatekeeper:**

- Block player surfaces containing spoilers
- Require diegetic phrasing for gates
- Validate Cold Manifest for spoiler safety

**Player-Narrator:**

- NEVER signal twists or behind-the-scenes causes
- Perform only from Cold, never Hot
- No foreshadowing by hinting mechanics

**Art/Audio:**

- No spoiler leitmotifs or visual telegraphing
- Captions atmospheric, not technical
- No twist allegiances visible in composition

**Style Lead:**

- Never fix clarity by revealing canon
- Prefer neutral wording or request Curator anchor
- Keep technique off surfaces

**Researcher:**

- Keep research details in Hot memos
- No source names on surfaces
- Provide player-safe alternative lines

## Validation

- Cold Manifest checks for spoiler content
- Gatekeeper blocks on spoiler presence
- Pre-gate review before surfaces ship
