playbook_id: hook_harvest
playbook_name: Hook Harvest
abbreviation: HH
version: 2.0.0
category: Discovery

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Sweep up newly proposed hooks (narrative, scene, factual, taxonomy), remove duplicates, cluster related ideas, and triage what should advance now, later, or never."

outcome: "A prioritized, tagged hook set ready for Lore Deepening (canonization) and follow-on loops, with risks and dependencies made explicit."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "After Story Spark or any burst of drafting that produced hooks"
    - "Before a stabilization window or merge train"
    - "On demand when the backlog looks fuzzy or drifted"
  tu_format: "tu-hook-harvest-<date>"
  showrunner_decision: "Confirms whether Researcher is active (affects factual triage)"

# Inputs
inputs:
  - "Hook cards in Hot SoT with status 'proposed'"
  - "Recent topology notes, section drafts, style addenda"
  - "Open QA notes from Gatekeeper (integrity/reachability/nonlinearity risks)"
  - "Prior harvest decisions (for consistency)"

# Core procedures
procedures:
  primary:
    - "@procedure:hook_triaging"
    - "@procedure:clustering"
    - "@procedure:artifact_validation"
  supporting:
    - "@procedure:tu_lifecycle"

# Validation requirements
validation_requirements:
  critical: "All roles producing JSON artifacts in this loop MUST validate before handoff"
  reference: "@snippet:validation_reminder"
  hard_gate: "Invalid artifacts STOP the loop. No exceptions."

# Procedure steps
procedure_steps:
  - step: 1
    name: "Open Hook Harvest TU"
    owner: "@adapter:showrunner"
    action: "Open TU and broadcast to consulted roles"
    protocol_intent: "tu.open"

  - step: 2
    name: "Collect"
    action: "Sweep all new 'proposed' hooks; reject obvious dupes; link provenance"

  - step: 3
    name: "Cluster"
    action: "Group by theme (e.g., 'Wormhole economy', 'Kestrel arc'), then by type (narrative|scene|factual|taxonomy)"

  - step: 4
    name: "Annotate"
    action: "Add or confirm triage tags, uncertainty levels, dependencies for each hook"
    triage_tags:
      - quick-win
      - needs-research
      - structure-impact
      - style-impact
      - deferred
      - reject
    uncertainty: "For factual: uncorroborated:low/med/high with any citations"

  - step: 5
    name: "Decide"
    owner: "@adapter:showrunner"
    action: "Mark each as accepted, deferred, or rejected (with 1-line reason)"
    protocol_intents:
      - "hook.accept (to owner role for next loop)"
      - "hook.defer (with wake conditions)"
      - "hook.reject (with reason and provenance)"

  - step: 6
    name: "Package"
    action: "Produce Harvest Sheet summarizing decisions for hand-off"

# Deliverables
deliverables:
  harvest_sheet:
    format: "Human text; attach to TU"
    contents:
      - "Date and TU-ID"
      - "Cluster headings with lists of hooks (accepted/deferred/rejected)"
      - "Risk notes (dormant Researcher? style pressure? topology churn?)"
      - "Activation requests (roles Showrunner should wake for next loops)"

  updated_hooks:
    contents:
      - "Status set (accepted/deferred/rejected)"
      - "Triage tags"
      - "Uncertainty level"
      - "Dependencies"

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Hooks are deduped, clustered, and tagged; uncertainty visible"
  - "Clear next loop and owner for each accepted hook"
  - "Showrunner has a short activation list (which dormant roles to wake)"
  - "Gatekeeper has a risk snapshot aligned to Quality Bars"

# Failure modes & remedies
failure_modes:
  foggy_clusters:
    symptom: "Hooks clustered by source role instead of player value"
    remedy: "Recut by player value instead of source role"

  endless_acceptance:
    symptom: "Too many hooks accepted without capacity check"
    remedy: "Enforce capacity; defer with explicit wake conditions"

  taxonomy_canon_confusion:
    symptom: "Taxonomy hooks becoming secret lore"
    remedy: "Hand to Lore Weaver or mark 'deferred'; Curator does not canonize"

  research_dormant_risk:
    symptom: "Research dormant but factual heavy"
    remedy: "Accept with uncorroborated:<risk> only if Showrunner signs the risk; otherwise defer"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - integrity  # Traceability
  secondary:
    - planning_hygiene  # Clear ownership, scope control

# Handoffs
handoffs:
  to_lore_deepening:
    content: "Accepted list (narrative/scene/factual hooks requiring canon)"
    format: "Clustered by theme, with dependencies and uncertainty notes"

  to_story_spark:
    content: "Hooks that re-shape topology"

  to_codex_expansion:
    content: "Taxonomy/clarity hooks accepted (player-safe coverage)"

  to_style_tune_up:
    content: "Hooks whose primary effect is tone/voice/aesthetics"
