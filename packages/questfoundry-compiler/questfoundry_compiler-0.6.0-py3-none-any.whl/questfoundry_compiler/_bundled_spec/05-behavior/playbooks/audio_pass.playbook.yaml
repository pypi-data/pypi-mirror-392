playbook_name: Audio Pass
abbreviation: AP
version: 2.0.0
category: Asset

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Decide what the audience should hear and why—ambience, foley, stingers, or voice—then (optionally) produce audio that fits style and narrative intent without leaking spoilers. This loop supports plan-only merges when the Audio Producer is dormant."

outcome: "An Audio Plan (cues, purpose, timing/placement, captions/text-equivalents, safety notes) and, if active, audio assets with reproducibility notes. Ready for Gatekeeper checks and merge to Cold (plans may merge as deferred; assets merge only on full pass)."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "A chapter/scene needs mood scaffolding or clarifying sound cues"
    - "Style Lead requests motif reinforcement via sound"
    - "Replacement/upgrade of existing sounds or VO"
    - "Export targets include audio plan/assets"
  tu_format: "tu-audio-<scope>"
  showrunner_decision: "Confirm Audio Director/Audio Producer activation; either may be dormant"

# RACI assignments
raci:
  responsible:
    - role: "@adapter:audio_director"
      responsibilities: "Choose cue targets and why; specify placement, duration, intensity; write player-safe cue descriptions and captions/text-equivalents"
    - role: "@adapter:audio_producer"
      responsibilities: "If active: create/arrange/mix assets; export masters; log reproducibility notes"
  accountable:
    - role: "@adapter:showrunner"
      responsibilities: "Scope the pass; decide plan-only vs asset production; sequence merge"
  consulted:
    - role: "@adapter:style_lead"
      responsibilities: "Ensure audio language aligns with register/motifs; veto drift"
    - role: "@adapter:player_narrator"
      responsibilities: "Confirm cues can be referenced diegetically when appropriate; never expose technique"
    - role: "@adapter:translator"
      responsibilities: "If active: flag VO/linguistic content and localization needs"
    - role: "@adapter:gatekeeper"
      responsibilities: "Check Presentation Safety (no spoilers; safe levels), Style, and Determinism/Reproducibility (when promised)"

# Inputs
inputs:
  - "Cold snapshot (canon, codex, style guardrails)"
  - "Target scenes/sections (Hot drafts acceptable for planning)"
  - "PN Principles (diegetic references; no plumbing)"
  - "Accessibility requirements (text equivalents, loudness safety)"
  - "Localization posture (Translator active or dormant)"

# Core procedures
procedures:
  primary:
    - "@procedure:cue_slot_selection"
    - "@procedure:audio_plan_authoring"
    - "@procedure:leitmotif_management"

# Merge options
merge_options:
  plan_only: "Plans merge as deferred without asset production"
  full_pass: "Plans + assets merge together"

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Audio Plans specify purpose, placement, intensity, captions/text-equivalents, safety notes"
  - "If assets: match plan intent; determinism logged off-surface"
  - "No spoilers in captions or text equivalents"
  - "Audio language consistent with Style register/motifs"
  - "Safety: no extreme volumes, startles marked, accessible text equivalents"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # Text equivalents player-safe; no technique in captions
    - accessibility  # Safety notes (intensity, startle); text equivalents present
  secondary:
    - style          # Captions portable; register aligned
    - determinism    # Logs off-surface when promised

# Handoffs
handoffs:
  to_audio_producer:
    content: "Audio plans for production"
    condition: "If Audio Producer active"

  to_gatekeeper:
    content: "Plans and assets for Presentation and Accessibility checks"
