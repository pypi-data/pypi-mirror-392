playbook_name: Narration Dry-Run
abbreviation: NDR
version: 2.0.0
category: Export

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Have the Player-Narrator (PN) play through the current Cold snapshot exactly as a player would experience it—in-world, spoiler-safe—to surface UX issues in comprehension, choice clarity, pacing, and diegetic gate enforcement."

outcome: "A set of PN playtest notes and handoff tickets (Trace Units or edit notes) that improve player-facing surfaces without rewriting canon or topology during the dry-run itself."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "After a Binding Run exports a view on Cold (chapter/act/book)"
    - "Before user playtests, recordings, or live demos"
    - "When PN phrasing patterns or recaps were recently updated"
  tu_format: "tu-pn-dryrun-<date|milestone>"
  snapshot_requirement: "Same Cold snapshot used by the Binding Run"

# RACI assignments

  accountable:
    - role: "@adapter:showrunner"
      responsibilities: "Scope routes to test; decide depth (single path vs sample of branches)"
  consulted:
    - role: "@adapter:gatekeeper"
      responsibilities: "Classify issues against Presentation Safety, Integrity, Style bars"
    - role: "@adapter:style_lead"
      responsibilities: "Advise on voice/register adjustments; review PN phrasing patterns"

      responsibilities: "Investigate navigation issues (anchors, labels, layout)"
    - role: "@adapter:codex_curator"
      responsibilities: "Address codex coverage gaps or cross-ref problems"
    - role: "@adapter:translator"
      responsibilities: "If testing a localized slice, flag mistransfers in tone/links"

# Inputs
inputs:
  - "Exported bundle from Binding Run (Markdown/HTML/EPUB/PDF)"
  - "PN Principles (in-world, spoiler-safe, diegetic gates)"
  - "Style guardrails (voice/register/motifs)"
  - "Language Pack if testing a non-source language"
  - "CRITICAL: PN reads Cold only—no Hot drafts, no canon notes"

# UX issue categories
ux_issue_tags:
  - choice_ambiguity    # Choice labels unclear or too similar
  - gate_friction       # Gate phrasing confusing or meta
  - nav_bug             # Navigation broken or confusing
  - tone_wobble         # Register/voice inconsistency
  - translation_glitch  # Localization issues
  - accessibility       # Pacing, caption, or contrast issues

# Route planning
route_plan:
  representative_paths:
    - "Hub route (fan-out)"
    - "Loop return (with difference)"
    - "Gated branch"
    - "At least one terminal"
  edge_cases: "Pick one 'weird' edge case if time-boxed"

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "All selected routes played through as player would experience"
  - "UX issues logged with tags, locations, severity"
  - "No creative rewrites or canon invented during dry-run"
  - "Handoff tickets created for owner roles (Scene, Style, Curator, Binder)"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # Diegetic gates; no internals leak
    - accessibility  # Pace, contrast, caption usefulness
    - gateways       # Gate phrasing enforceable in-world
  secondary:
    - style          # Tone wobble detection
    - nonlinearity   # Choice ambiguity
    - integrity      # Nav bugs, broken refs
