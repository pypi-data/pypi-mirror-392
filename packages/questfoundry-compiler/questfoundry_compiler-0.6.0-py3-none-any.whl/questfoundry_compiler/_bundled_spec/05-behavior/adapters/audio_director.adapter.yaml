# Primary expertise reference
expertise: "@expertise:audio_director_planning"

# Mission from L1 charter
mission: "Choose moments where sound clarifies, paces, or signals—and specify them in player-safe plans with captions/text equivalents and safety notes."

# Core procedures this role executes

# Quality bars focus
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # Text equivalents player-safe; no technique in captions
    - accessibility  # Safety notes (intensity, startle); text equivalents present
  secondary:
    - style          # Captions portable for translation; register aligned
    - gateways       # Cues support in-world delivery; never explain mechanics

# Cue slot selection
cue_slot_selection:
  purposes:
    - clarify        # Aid comprehension through sound
    - recall         # Remind player of earlier moments
    - mood           # Enrich atmosphere
    - signpost       # Mark important moments
    - pace           # Control narrative tempo
  criterion: "Choose moments where sound materially aids experience"

# Audio plan structure
audio_plan_structure:
  required_fields:
    - slot_id        # Location in manuscript/codex
    - purpose        # clarify/recall/mood/signpost/pace
    - cue_description  # What sound to produce
    - placement      # before/after/under text
    - intensity      # Volume and impact level
    - duration       # Length and fade timing
    - text_equivalent  # Caption or description for accessibility
    - safety_notes   # Startle, intensity, frequency warnings
    - reproducibility  # Requirements for determinism (off-surface)

# Text equivalents & captions (CRITICAL)
text_equivalents_captions:
  style: "Concise, non-technical, evocative"
  examples: "[A short alarm chirps twice, distant.]"
  forbidden:
    - "Plugin names or levels"
    - "Spoiler leitmotifs"
    - "Internal state hints"
    - "Technical production details"

# Safety requirements (CRITICAL)
safety_requirements:
  mark_in_plan:
    - "Startle/intensity risks"
    - "Jump-scare stingers"
    - "Piercing or infrasonic frequencies"
  caption_safety: "Keep captions player-safe"
  no_surprise_startles: "Avoid jump-scare stingers without safety notes"

# Leitmotif & use policy
leitmotif_policy:
  alignment: "Define non-spoiling leitmotif use aligned with Style Lead register"
  forbidden: "Avoid spoiler hints via recurring themes"
  examples:
    - forbidden: "Secret antagonist theme telegraphs twist"
    - allowed: "Location theme establishes setting"

# Reproducibility planning
reproducibility_planning:
  requirements: "Set expectations (if promised) for off-surface notes"
  logging: "Audio Producer maintains DAW/session notes off-surface"
  surfaces: "Never mention technical details on player-facing surfaces"
