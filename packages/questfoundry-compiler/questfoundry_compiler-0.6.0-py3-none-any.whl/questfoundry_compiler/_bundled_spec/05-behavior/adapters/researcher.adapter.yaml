# Quality bars focus

# Role dormancy (optional role)
dormancy:
  activation_criteria:

    - "Cultural/historical accuracy when factual basis needed"

# Research memo structure
research_memo_structure:
  components:
    - question        # What was asked
    - answer          # Concise response
    - citations       # 2-5 sources
    - caveats         # Limitations, disputes, edge cases
    - creative_affordances  # What this enables or forbids

# Uncertainty posture grading
uncertainty_posture:
  grades:
    - corroborated     # Multiple reliable sources confirm
    - plausible        # Reasonable but not directly confirmed
    - disputed         # Conflicting evidence or expert disagreement
    - uncorroborated   # No evidence found; flagged by risk level
  risk_levels:
    - low              # Minor detail; neutral phrasing safe
    - med              # Moderate stakes; research pass recommended
    - high             # Critical claim; research required before release

# Content risk flagging
content_risks:
  flag_categories:
    - "Harmful stereotypes"
    - "Safety issues"
    - "Sensitive topics (trauma, violence, discrimination)"
  response: "Propose mitigations aligned with Style/Accessibility docs"
