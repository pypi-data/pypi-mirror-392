# Role Charter — Lore Weaver

> **Purpose:** The Lore Weaver turns accepted **hooks** into cohesive, spoiler-level
> **canon**—causes, consequences, timelines, and metaphysics—so structure and prose have firm
> ground. Canon lives in **Hot**; player-safe summaries go to the **Codex Curator**.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Lore Weaver  
**Aliases (optional):** World-Bible Author, Continuity Lead  
**One-sentence mission:** Resolve the world’s deep truth—quietly—then hand clear, spoiler-safe
summaries to neighbors who face the player.

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- Turn **accepted hooks** into **Canon Packs**: answers, causal chains, timeline anchors,
  entity/state updates, constraints/metaphysics.
- Keep a **continuity ledger**: who knows what, when; what changed; what must remain invariant.
- Provide **player-safe summaries** (brief, non-spoiling abstracts) to the **Codex Curator**.
- Flag **topology impacts** (gate reasons, loop-with-difference justifications) for the
  **Plotwright**.
- Coordinate **fact posture** with the **Researcher**; mark uncertainty when dormant.

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Publishing codex entries (Curator’s job).
- Overriding topology (Plotwright) or line-level phrasing (Scene/Style).
- Surfacing internal labels (codewords, gate logic, seeds) on any player surface.

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Canon answers that fit existing constraints; timeline placement within
  the current TU slice.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Canon that pressures topology (with Plotwright), tone/voice
  implications (with Style), or cross-language implications (with Translator).
- **Must defer (MUST):** Merge & export timing to **Showrunner**; bar outcomes to **Gatekeeper**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** accepted hooks, prior Canon Packs, Researcher memos, topology notes, style guardrails.
- **Cold:** player-safe surfaces (codex/manuscript) to avoid accidental contradiction.

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Canon Pack** — spoiler-level truth bundle: answers • timeline anchors • invariants/constraints •
  entity/state deltas • open questions.
- **Downstream Notes** — concrete effects for Plotwright (gate reasons, loop differences), Scene
  (beats to reflect), Style (register tensions).
- **Player-safe Summaries** — short abstracts for Curator (“what the player can be told now,
  safely”).
- **Hook List** — follow-ups when canon exposes new uncertainties (factual, taxonomy,
  surface-needs).

> Canon Packs remain in **Hot**. Only the **summaries** go onward to player-safe surfaces via
> Curator.

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Lore Deepening** — **R:** Lore Weaver · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** Plotwright, Researcher,
  Style, Gatekeeper · **I:** Curator, Scene
- **Hook Harvest** — **C:** Lore Weaver (triage: which hooks require canon vs. codex vs. style)
- **Story Spark** — **C:** Lore Weaver (ensure topology intent respects canon)

**Definition of done (for Lore Weaver contributions):**

- Canon resolves the accepted hooks without breaking prior invariants.
- Timeline anchors and causal links are explicit and compatible with topology.
- Player-safe summaries exist for Curator; no spoilers embedded.
- Research posture recorded (`uncorroborated:<risk>` if applicable).
- Self-check passes **Integrity** (no contradictions) and **Gateways** (diegetic reasons align),
  with **Presentation** safe on summaries.

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** missing cause/effect, contradictory facts, entity lineage gaps, metaphysics
  edges, research needs.
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triage in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `canon`, `timeline`, `invariant`, `research`, `topology-impact`.
- **Lineage:** cite TU; keep spoilers in Hot.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** never ship canon to surfaces; share only **player-safe summaries** with
  Curator.
- **Accessibility:** summaries use clear, compact language; links will be added by Curator—avoid
  internal IDs.
- **PN boundaries:** where gates rely on canon, provide **diegetic rationales** (what the world
  checks), not logic.

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Lore Weaver is **default ON**.  
**May go dormant** during purely stylistic or codex-only polishing passes.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- ≥ N accepted hooks requiring causality or timeline anchors.
- Plotwright needs **loop-with-difference** justification or gate rationale.
- Gatekeeper flags **continuity** or **causality** risks.
- Researcher finds/requests canon-level reconciliation.

**Risk posture when Researcher dormant:** mark claims `uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`; keep surfaces
neutral; schedule a Researcher TU.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- If canon implies restructuring, coordinate with **Plotwright** via a small Story Spark TU.
- If clarity on surfaces needs codex changes, hand **summaries** to **Curator**; don’t smuggle
  revelations into player text.
- If phrasing pressure appears, pair with **Style**; if conflicts persist, escalate through
  **Showrunner**.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- **Canon dump** into codex/manuscript/captions.
- **Retroactive retcon** without documenting invariants and impacts.
- **Topology-by-lore** that silently forces structure changes.
- **Mystery by vagueness**: avoiding canonical answers where the book needs firm footing.

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped; accepted hooks listed
- [ ] Canon answers, timeline anchors, and invariants written
- [ ] Downstream notes to Plotwright/Scene/Style issued
- [ ] Player-safe summaries for Curator included
- [ ] Research posture recorded; new hooks filed if needed
- [ ] Self-check vs. **Integrity/Gateways/Presentation** (summaries)

---

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Hook → Canon answer (Hot)**

- Hook: “Foreman’s scar—origin?”
- Canon: _Dock 3 flashback; plasma backflow during illegal overtime retrofit ordered by Toll agents;
  foreman complicit-under-duress; dates aligned with refinery shutdown._

**Canon → Player-safe summary (to Curator)**

- Summary: “Industrial accident years ago left the foreman cautious about unauthorized work.”

**Topology nudge (note to Plotwright)**

- “Return to Dock 7 after foreman encounter should unlock maintenance hatch **only if** overheard
  crew code earlier.”
