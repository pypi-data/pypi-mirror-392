# Art Plan Authoring

## Purpose

Provide complete, player-safe specifications for illustrations that guide the Illustrator while maintaining style consistency and accessibility standards.

## Core Principles

- **Comprehensive Specification**: Plans must include all elements needed for rendering
- **Player-Safe Content**: No spoilers, internal labels, or technique exposure in any visible element
- **Accessibility First**: Alt guidance and captions must be concrete and meaningful
- **Style Alignment**: Visual language consistent with Style Lead's register and motif palette

## Steps

1. **Define Subject**: Clearly describe the primary subject and any secondary elements
2. **Specify Composition**: State compositional intent (framing, perspective, focal points)
3. **Detail Iconography**: Identify key visual symbols or motifs to include
4. **Set Light & Mood**: Describe lighting direction, intensity, and emotional tone
5. **Draft Caption**: Write player-safe caption (atmospheric or clarifying, no spoilers)
6. **Provide Alt Guidance**: Specify alt text requirements (concrete nouns/relations)
7. **Note Variants**: Document crop/variant needs if required
8. **Set Determinism Requirements**: Mark reproducibility needs if promised (logged off-surface)

## Outputs

- **Art Plan**: Complete specification per slot including:
  - Subject description
  - Composition intent
  - Iconography notes
  - Light and mood direction
  - Player-safe caption
  - Alt text guidance
  - Crop/variant notes
  - Determinism requirements (if applicable)

## Quality Checks

- Caption contains no spoilers, internals, or technique references
- Alt guidance specifies concrete, player-safe content
- Visual elements support diegetic gates without explaining mechanics
- Composition aligns with Style Lead's motif palette
- Plan enables Illustrator to render without guessing
