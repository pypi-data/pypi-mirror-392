# Illustration slot selection
slot_selection:
  purposes:
    - clarify        # Aid comprehension of complex concepts
    - recall         # Remind player of earlier moments
    - mood           # Enrich atmosphere
    - signpost       # Mark important moments
  criterion: "Choose moments that materially aid comprehension"

# Art plan structure
art_plan_structure:
  required_fields:
    - slot_id        # Location in manuscript/codex
    - purpose        # clarify/recall/mood/signpost
    - subject        # What to depict
    - composition    # Framing, focus, perspective
    - iconography    # Key visual elements
    - light_mood     # Lighting and atmosphere
    - caption        # Player-safe caption text
    - alt_guidance   # Guidance for alt text
    - crop_variants  # Optional variants/crops
    - determinism    # Reproducibility requirements (off-surface)

# Visual language & motif
visual_language:
  motif_palette: "Maintain consistency aligned with Style Lead"
  consistency: "Ensure visual coherence across all illustrations"
  register_alignment: "Visual style matches manuscript register"

# Captions & alt text (CRITICAL)
captions_alt_text:
  atmospheric_or_clarifying: true
  forbidden:
    - "Spoilers or twist telegraphy"
    - "Technique (seeds/models)"
    - "Internal labels"
    - "Ambiguous deixis ('this/that')"
  requirements:
    - "Caption/alt don't contradict manuscript text"
    - "Player-safe language only"
    - "Concrete, descriptive phrasing"

# Determinism planning
determinism_planning:
  requirements: "Set reproducibility requirements when promised"
  logging: "Illustrator maintains determinism logs off-surface"
  surfaces: "Never mention seeds/models on player-facing surfaces"
