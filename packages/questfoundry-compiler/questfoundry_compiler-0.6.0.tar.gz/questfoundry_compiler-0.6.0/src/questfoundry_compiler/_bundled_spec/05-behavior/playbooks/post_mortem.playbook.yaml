# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Conduct a structured retrospective after completing a major milestone, release, or significant TU cluster. Extract actionable lessons, identify process improvements, track quality bar trends, and update best practices to reduce recurring issues and strengthen the workflow."

outcome: "A post-mortem report documenting successes, failures, surprising discoveries, and concrete action items with owners and deadlines."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "After major milestone completion (chapter release, act completion, full book export)"
    - "After a significant TU cluster or multi-loop pass completes (e.g., 5+ related TUs)"
    - "When recurring quality bar issues suggest systemic process review needed"
    - "Periodic retrospectives (e.g., quarterly, per-release cycle)"
    - "After protocol violations or critical incidents (immediate post-mortem)"
  tu_format: "tu-post-mortem-<milestone|incident>"
