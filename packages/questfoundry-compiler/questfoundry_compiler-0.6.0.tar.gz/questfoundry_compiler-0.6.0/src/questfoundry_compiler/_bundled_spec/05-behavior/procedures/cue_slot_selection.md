# Cue Slot Selection

## Purpose

Choose moments where sound clarifies, paces, or signals—and specify them in player-safe plans with captions/text equivalents and safety notes.

## Core Principles

- **Purpose-Driven Selection**: Each slot must serve one or more clear purposes:
  - **Clarify**: Aid comprehension through sonic cues
  - **Recall**: Audio callback to prior moments or themes
  - **Mood**: Enhance emotional atmosphere
  - **Signpost**: Mark important narrative transitions
  - **Pace**: Control rhythm and momentum

- **Material Aid**: Only select slots where sound materially enhances player experience

- **Safety-Conscious**: Consider intensity, startle potential, and accessibility from the start

## Steps

1. **Review Content**: Examine manuscript sections, scene briefs, and narrative pacing
2. **Identify Candidates**: Mark moments where audio would enhance experience
3. **State Purpose**: For each candidate, explicitly identify which purpose(s) it serves
4. **Assess Safety**: Note potential startle, intensity, or accessibility concerns
5. **Prioritize Impact**: Choose slots with highest material benefit to experience
6. **Coordinate with Style**: Ensure selections align with register and pacing
7. **Document in Cuelist**: Record planned slots with purpose, owner, and status

## Outputs

- **Audio Cue Requests**: Identified moments requiring audio
- **Cuelist Updates**: Ordered map of slots with purposes and priorities
- **Safety Flags**: Initial safety notes for intensity or startle concerns
- **Coordination Hooks**: Requests to PN for cadence coordination, Curator for anchors

## Quality Checks

- Each selected slot has clear, stated purpose
- Safety considerations noted for intensity or startle
- Text equivalents will be required for all cues
- Selections support diegetic delivery, never explain mechanics
- Cuelist maintains traceability to source content
