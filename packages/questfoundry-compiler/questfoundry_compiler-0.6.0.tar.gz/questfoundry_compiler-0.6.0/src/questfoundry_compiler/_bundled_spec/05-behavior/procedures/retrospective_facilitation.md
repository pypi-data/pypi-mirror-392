# Retrospective Facilitation Procedure

## Overview

Run structured post-mortem session that maintains blameless culture, encourages candid feedback, and produces actionable improvements.

## Source

Extracted from v1 `spec/05-prompts/loops/post_mortem.playbook.md` Steps 3-4: "Frame Retrospective" and "Retrospective Session"

## Steps

### Step 1: Set Scope and Context

Open the retrospective with clear boundaries:

- Milestone, date range, or incident scope
- List of TUs and work under review
- Participating roles (all who contributed)
- Timebox session (60-90 minutes for major milestones)

### Step 2: Establish Blameless Culture

Set ground rules for productive discussion:

- Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- "What about our process allowed this?" not "Who made the mistake?"
- Celebrate learning and transparency
- Assume good intent from all participants

### Step 3: Frame Four Categories

Structure discussion around standard retrospective format:

- **What went well**: Successes, effective practices
- **What went poorly**: Pain points, blockers, inefficiencies
- **Surprising discoveries**: Unexpected insights, emergent patterns
- **Improvements to try**: Specific proposals for next cycle

### Step 4: Facilitate Contributions

Ensure all roles participate:

- No silent observers
- Encourage candid, specific feedback
- Balance positive and improvement-focused discussion
- Ask open-ended questions to draw out insights

### Step 5: Document in Real-Time

Capture discussion as it happens:

- Record items in each category
- Note who raised each point for context
- Capture specific examples and anecdotes
- Flag items requiring follow-up action

### Step 6: Redirect Unproductive Patterns

Intervene when discussion veers off-track:

- If blame emerges: redirect to systems thinking
- If too vague: request specific examples
- If too many topics: focus on highest-impact items
- If one voice dominates: solicit other perspectives

## Output

Facilitated retrospective session with documented insights in all four categories and full participation.

## Quality Criteria

- All participating roles contribute
- Blameless culture maintained throughout
- Specific examples provided (not vague generalizations)
- Balanced coverage of positives and improvements
- Session stays within timebox
- Real-time documentation captured
