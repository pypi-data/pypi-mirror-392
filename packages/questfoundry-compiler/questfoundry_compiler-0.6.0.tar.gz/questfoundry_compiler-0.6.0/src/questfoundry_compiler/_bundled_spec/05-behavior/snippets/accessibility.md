# Accessibility

## Core Principle

All player-facing content must be usable with assistive technology and readable at variable skill levels.

## Requirements by Medium

### Text Content

**Links:**

- ✓ Descriptive: "See Salvage Permits"
- ✗ Generic: "click here", "read more"
- Never use deixis: "this", "that" without context

**Sentence Length:**

- Readable, varied rhythm
- Avoid dense multi-clause constructions
- Break up 10+ sentence paragraphs
- Short under pressure (1-2 sentences), longer in reflection (3)

**Headings:**

- Descriptive and hierarchical
- Enable navigation via heading structure
- Avoid "Section 1", "Part A" without descriptive text

### Images

**Alt Text (REQUIRED):**

- One sentence, concrete
- Avoid "image of..." phrasing
- Concrete nouns/relations, not subjective mood
- Example: ✓ "Frost patterns web the airlock glass"
- Example: ✗ "A beautiful and mysterious scene"

**Captions:**

- Atmospheric or clarifying
- No spoilers, no technique
- Avoid ambiguous deixis ("this/that")
- Ensure caption/alt don't contradict text

### Audio

**Text Equivalents (REQUIRED):**

- Concise, evocative, non-technical
- Example: "[A short alarm chirps twice, distant.]"
- No plugin names or levels

**Safety Notes (CRITICAL):**

- Mark startle/intensity risks
- Avoid extreme panning or frequencies causing fatigue
- Ensure volume targets comfortable
- Mark: startle peaks, infrasonic rumble, piercing frequencies

**Captions:**

- Synchronized and player-safe
- No spoiler or technique references
- Portable for translation

## Role-Specific Applications

**Player-Narrator:**

- Steady pacing
- Pronounceable phrasing
- Descriptive references
- Render captions/alt as atmosphere, not technique

**Style Lead:**

- Enforce descriptive links
- Readable sentence length
- Clear alt/caption phrasing
- Ban meta directives ("click", "flag")

**Translator:**

- Maintain descriptive links
- Concise alt text
- Readable sentence length in target language
- Adapt punctuation/numerals for legibility

**Codex Curator:**

- Descriptive headings
- Descriptive link text
- Simple sentences
- Assume variable reading levels
- If figures appear, provide alt text

**Researcher:**

- Prefer concrete, plain phrasing
- Avoid jargon unless Curator will publish entry
- Flag sensitive content with mitigations

**Audio Producer:**

- Avoid extreme panning/frequencies (fatigue)
- Ensure volume targets remain comfortable
- Mark startle peaks, infrasonic rumble, piercing frequencies

**Audio Director:**

- Safety notes (intensity, startle)
- Text equivalents present
- Captions portable for translation

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] All audio has text equivalents
- [ ] Links are descriptive (not "click here")
- [ ] Paragraphs under 10 sentences
- [ ] Headings are descriptive
- [ ] No meta directives
- [ ] Safety notes for audio intensity/startle
- [ ] Captions player-safe and synchronized

## Common Issues

**Missing Alt Text:**

- Every image must have alt attribute
- Generic alt ("image") not acceptable
- Must describe content concretely

**Generic Links:**

- "Click here" fails assistive tech navigation
- Link text should make sense out of context
- Avoid "learn more", "read this"

**Dense Text:**

- Long paragraphs fatigue readers
- Complex sentences reduce comprehension
- Break content into scannable chunks

**Audio Accessibility:**

- Lack of text equivalents excludes deaf/hard-of-hearing
- Lack of safety notes risks startle/discomfort
- Extreme panning/frequencies cause fatigue
