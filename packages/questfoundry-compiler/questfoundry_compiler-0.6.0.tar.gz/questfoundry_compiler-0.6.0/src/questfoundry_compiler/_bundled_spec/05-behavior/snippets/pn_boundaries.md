# PN Boundaries

## Core Principle

Player-Narrator performance must use only in-world language. All gates, refusals, and cues must be diegetically enforceable without exposing mechanics.

## Diegetic Gates Required

### In-World Checks

✓ "The scanner blinks red—no clearance badge"
✓ "The foreman eyes you: 'Union members only'"
✓ "The lock requires a hex-key you don't have"

✗ "Option locked"
✗ "You don't have FLAG_OMEGA"
✗ "Quest 'Foreman's Trust' incomplete"

### World Mechanisms

Gates must reference observable world elements:

- Physical objects (badges, keys, permits)
- Social standing (reputation, membership)
- Knowledge (ritual phrases, codes)
- Environmental state (time, location access)

## Role-Specific Applications

**Lore Weaver:**

- Provide diegetic rationales (what the world checks), not logic
- Support diegetic gate phrasing without exposing mechanics
- Example: "Airlocks require certified EVA training" not "if skill.eva >= 2"

**Style Lead:**

- Supply in-world refusals & gate lines
- No mechanic talk (e.g., "The scanner blinks red" not "CODEWORD missing")
- Provide substitutions for meta language

**Codex Curator:**

- Entries should support diegetic gate phrasing
- Example: What a "union token" does, not how it's checked
- Never describe internal checks or codewords

**Researcher:**

- Propose diegetic gate language where research affects checks
- Examples: permits, procedures, equipment limits
- Support in-world enforcement without exposing logic

**Book Binder:**

- Keep navigation text in-world
- No meta markers ("FLAG_X", "CODEWORD: ...")

**Art/Audio:**

- Imagery/cues support diegetic gates
- Never explain mechanics via visuals or sound
- Example: Show locked door, not "Requires Key Item"

**Translator:**

- Keep gates in-world
- Replace meta with diegetic cues fitting the language
- Maintain gate enforceability in translation

## Common Patterns

### Physical Barriers

- Locks requiring keys/tools
- Scanners requiring badges/biometrics
- Environmental hazards requiring equipment

### Social Barriers

- Authority figures checking credentials
- Reputation requirements for access
- Membership or allegiance checks

### Knowledge Barriers

- Ritual phrases or passwords
- Technical knowledge to operate systems
- Cultural understanding to navigate situations

### Temporal Barriers

- Time-of-day restrictions
- Event sequences requiring completion
- Cooldowns presented as world logic

## Validation

- Gatekeeper enforces diegetic phrasing
- Pre-gate checks for mechanic leakage
- PN dry-run testing for enforceability
