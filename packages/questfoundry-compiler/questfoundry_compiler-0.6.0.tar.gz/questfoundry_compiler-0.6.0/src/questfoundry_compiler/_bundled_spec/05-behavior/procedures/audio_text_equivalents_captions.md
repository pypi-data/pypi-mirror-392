# Audio Text Equivalents & Captions

## Purpose

Create player-safe text equivalents and captions that enhance accessibility and atmosphere without revealing spoilers, internals, or production technique.

## Core Principles

- **Player-Safe Content**: No spoilers, leitmotif hints at hidden info, or internal state
- **No Technique Exposure**: No plugin names, DAW details, technical levels, or production metadata
- **Concise & Evocative**: Text should enhance experience without excessive detail
- **Non-Technical Language**: Accessible to all players regardless of audio expertise
- **Portable for Translation**: Phrasing must work across languages

## Steps

1. **Draft Text Equivalent**: Write concise description of the sound
   - Focus on what players hear, not how it's made
   - Use evocative but accessible language
   - Target 1-2 sentences maximum
   - Example: "[A short alarm chirps twice, distant.]" not "[LFO sine 440Hz, -18dB, reverb wet 40%]"
2. **Check Spoiler Safety**: Ensure no leitmotif-as-spoiler patterns
   - No hidden allegiance signals
   - No internal state hints
   - No foreshadowing mechanics
3. **Verify Accessibility**: Confirm text provides equivalent experience
   - Conveys mood/atmosphere
   - Provides narrative context when needed
   - Works without hearing the audio
4. **Coordinate Terminology**: Ensure sound descriptions align with Curator's glossary
5. **Ensure Portability**: Confirm phrasing works for translation

## Outputs

- **Text Equivalents**: Concise, player-safe descriptions per audio cue
- **Caption Guidance**: Specifications for timing and presentation
- **Terminology Notes**: Coordination records with Codex Curator
- **Translation Coordination**: Portability notes for Translator

## Quality Checks

- Text equivalent contains no spoilers, internals, or technique references
- No leitmotif hints at hidden information or future twists
- Concise and evocative without technical jargon
- Accessible to players with varying audio expertise
- Portable for translation across languages
- Terminology consistent with Codex Curator's glossary
- Timing coordinated with Audio Producer for synchronization
