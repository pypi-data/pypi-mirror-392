playbook_name: Binding Run
abbreviation: BR
version: 2.0.0
category: Export

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Assemble a player-safe export view of the book from a specific Cold snapshot. Package manuscript, codex, and checklists—optionally including art/audio plans or assets and translation slices—without leaking spoilers or internal plumbing."

outcome: "A stamped export bundle (Markdown/HTML/EPUB/PDF) with front-matter metadata (snapshot ID, options used) and a View Log. No new canon is created; this loop does not write to Cold."

# Front matter requirements
front_matter:
  required_fields:
    - snapshot_id          # Reproducibility anchor
    - export_timestamp     # When view was generated
    - options              # Art/audio/language coverage
    - accessibility_summary # Alt text status, captions, contrast
    - coverage_notes       # Which sections/languages included

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Bundle assembled from single Cold snapshot only"
  - "All anchors and cross-links resolve correctly"
  - "Front matter complete with snapshot ID and options"
  - "No spoilers or internals in any player-facing surface"
  - "Accessibility: alt text present, descriptive links, readable structure"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - integrity      # TOC works; anchors resolve; no orphan pages
    - presentation   # No internal labels or technique leaks
    - accessibility  # Front matter, alt text, navigation
  secondary:
    - style          # Consistent heading and labeling
    - reachability   # Navigation enables keystones to be reached
