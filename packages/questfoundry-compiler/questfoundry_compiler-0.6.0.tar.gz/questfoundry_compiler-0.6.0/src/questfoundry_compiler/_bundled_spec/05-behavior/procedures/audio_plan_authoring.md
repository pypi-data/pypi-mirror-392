# Audio Plan Authoring

## Purpose

Provide complete, player-safe specifications for audio cues that guide the Audio Producer while maintaining safety, accessibility, and style standards.

## Core Principles

- **Comprehensive Specification**: Plans must include all elements needed for production
- **Safety First**: Mark intensity, startle, and accessibility concerns explicitly
- **Player-Safe Content**: Text equivalents contain no spoilers, internals, or technique
- **Style Alignment**: Cues align with Style Lead's register and pacing

## Steps

1. **Describe Cue**: Clearly describe the sound or musical element
2. **Specify Placement**: State timing (before/after/under text) and duration
3. **Set Intensity & Duration**: Define volume target, dynamic range, length
4. **Draft Text Equivalent**: Write player-safe caption/text equivalent
   - Concise, non-technical, evocative
   - Avoid plugin names or technical terms
5. **Document Safety Notes**: Mark startle risks, intensity warnings, frequency concerns
6. **Set Reproducibility Requirements**: Note if off-surface DAW/session logs needed
7. **Coordinate with PN**: Ensure placement doesn't disrupt cadence
8. **Coordinate with Translator**: Ensure text equivalents are portable

## Outputs

- **Audio Plan**: Complete specification per slot including:
  - Cue description
  - Placement (timing relative to text)
  - Intensity and duration
  - Text equivalent/caption (player-safe)
  - Safety notes (startle, intensity, frequency)
  - Reproducibility requirements (if applicable)

## Quality Checks

- Text equivalent contains no spoilers, internals, or technique references
- Safety notes present for all cues with startle or intensity concerns
- Placement coordinates with PN phrasing and cadence
- Cues support diegetic delivery without explaining mechanics
- Plan enables Audio Producer to render without guessing
- Text equivalents portable for translation
