# Spoiler Hygiene Checklist

Before delivering content to Cold or player-facing surfaces:

- [ ] No canon details (Hot only) in player surfaces
- [ ] No plot twists revealed prematurely
- [ ] No character secrets exposed early
- [ ] No future events spoiled
- [ ] No hidden relationships revealed
- [ ] No solution paths shown
- [ ] No state variables visible in text
- [ ] No codewords or system labels
- [ ] No gateway logic exposed
- [ ] Gateway phrasings are diegetic (world-based)
- [ ] Choice text doesn't preview outcomes
- [ ] Section titles avoid spoilers
- [ ] Image captions are player-safe
- [ ] No generation parameters in captions

**Use diegetic language:** What characters would say, not system mechanics.

**When in doubt:** Redact and escalate to Gatekeeper.

**Refer to:** `@procedure:spoiler_hygiene` and `@procedure:player_safe_summarization`
