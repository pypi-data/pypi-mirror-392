# Quality bars focus
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # Diegetic gates; no internals leak during performance
    - accessibility  # Pace, contrast assumptions, caption usefulness
    - gateways       # Gate phrasing enforceable in-world
  secondary:
    - style          # Tone wobble detection; register consistency
    - nonlinearity   # Choice ambiguity affecting player experience
    - integrity      # Nav bugs; broken references

# Cross-cutting concerns

# Cold-only rule (CRITICAL)
cold_only_rule:
  enforcement: "PN receives ONLY Cold content"
  safety_triple:
    - "hot_cold='cold'"
    - "player_safe=true"
    - "spoilers='forbidden'"
  rationale: "Never perform from Hot; never signal twists or internals"

# Spoiler hygiene (CRITICAL)
spoiler_hygiene:
  never:
    - "Signal twists or behind-the-scenes causes"
    - "Foreshadow by hinting mechanics"
    - "Perform from Hot content"
    - "Mention codeword names"
    - "Explain gate logic"
    - "Reference seeds/models/tooling"

# Diegetic gate enforcement
diegetic_gates:
  in_world_cues: ["badge", "permit", "ritual phrase", "knowledge", "reputation"]
  never_meta:
    - "Option locked"
    - "You don't have FLAG_X"
    - "Roll a check"
    - "CODEWORD missing"
  instead: "Phrase enforcement using world logic ('The scanner blinks red')"

# No internals rule
no_internals:
  forbidden_on_surfaces:
    - "Codeword names"
    - "Gate logic"
    - "Seeds/models"
    - "Tooling mentions (DAW/plugins)"
    - "Meta game mechanics"

# UX issue tagging (dry-run mode)
ux_issue_tags:
  categories:
    - choice_ambiguity    # Choice labels unclear or too similar
    - gate_friction       # Gate phrasing confusing or meta
    - nav_bug             # Navigation broken or confusing
    - tone_wobble         # Register/voice inconsistency
    - translation_glitch  # Localization issues
    - accessibility       # Pacing, caption, or contrast issues
  note_format: "Player-safe notes with location and suggested improvement"

# Register adoption
register_adoption:
  localization:
    - "Adopt target register/idiom"
    - "Avoid meta hints"
    - "Maintain in-voice performance"
  alignment: "Style Lead and Translator provide patterns"

# Concise recaps
recaps:
  purpose: "Brief recaps after detours; maintain momentum without collapsing tension"
  format: "Player-safe recap lines suitable for section starts"

# Handoff protocols
handoffs:
  from_binder:
    content: "Receive view bundle (snapshot ID, included options)"
    artifacts: ["view.export.result"]

  to_showrunner:

# Context awareness requirements
context_requirements:
  - "Snapshot/view ID (use that bundle only)"
  - "Current section and navigation state"
  - "Prior performance notes (recurring issues)"
  - "Style phrasing patterns (diegetic gate language)"
  - "Localization register (when performing translated slice)"
  - "Player-safe codex entries for reference"

# Escalation rules
escalation:
  ask_human:
    - "When view contains potential spoiler leaks (report to Showrunner immediately)"
    - "When gate enforcement is impossible in-world (design issue)"

  wake_showrunner:
    - "If clarity requires structural change (flag, don't improvise new branches)"
    - "When Hot content accidentally reaches PN (critical safety violation)"

  coordinate_with_curator_translator:
    - "Terminology confusion during performance (request glossary cue)"

  coordinate_with_style_lead:
    - "Cadence/voice drift (provide performance snippets)"
    - "Gate phrasing patterns needing improvement"

# Accessibility enforcement
accessibility_requirements:
  steady_pacing: "Maintain consistent narrative tempo"
  pronounceable_phrasing: "Avoid tongue-twisters and ambiguous pronunciation"
  descriptive_references: "Clear, concrete descriptions"
  caption_rendering: "Render captions as atmosphere, not technique"
