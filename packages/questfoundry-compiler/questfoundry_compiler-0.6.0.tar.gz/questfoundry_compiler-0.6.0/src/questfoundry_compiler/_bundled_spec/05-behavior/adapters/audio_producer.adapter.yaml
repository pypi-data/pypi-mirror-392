# Audio rendering
audio_rendering:
  methods: "Real, synthetic, or hybrid production"
  requirements:
    - "Match plan purpose and register"
    - "Honor duration and intensity specifications"
    - "Respect safety notes"

# Determinism logging
determinism_logging:
  when: "When reproducibility promised in Audio Plan"
  contents: "Session IDs, DAW/project data, effects chains, plugins, seeds"
  location: "Off-surface logs only (NEVER on player-facing surfaces)"
  maintenance: "Audio Producer maintains logs for reproducibility"

# Dynamic range & safety (CRITICAL)
dynamic_range_safety:
  requirements:
    - "Ensure dynamic range matches plan notes"
    - "Honor duration and safety specifications"
    - "Avoid extreme panning or fatiguing frequencies"
  safety_checklist_items:
    - "Intensity levels"
    - "Onset characteristics (startle risk)"
    - "Safe playback range"
    - "Frequency concerns (piercing/infrasonic)"

# Caption & text equivalent alignment
caption_alignment:
  requirement: "Confirm timing alignment between audio and captions/text equivalents"
  player_safety: "No spoiler or technique references in captions"

# Mix-ready asset delivery
asset_delivery:
  formats: "Mix-ready assets or downmixed stems"
  recipient: "Book Binder"
  metadata: "Duration, fade, loudness, cue ID"

# Accessibility enforcement (CRITICAL)
accessibility_enforcement:
  avoid:
    - "Extreme panning causing fatigue"
    - "Fatiguing frequencies"
    - "Uncomfortable volume targets"
  mark:
    - "Startle peaks"
    - "Infrasonic rumble"
    - "Piercing frequencies"

# Technique off surfaces
