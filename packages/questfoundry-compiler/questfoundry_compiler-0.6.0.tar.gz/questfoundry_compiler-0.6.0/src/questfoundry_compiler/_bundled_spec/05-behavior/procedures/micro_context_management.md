# Micro-Context Management

## Purpose

Add minimal clarifying prose (1-2 lines) before choices to prevent ambiguity, without spoiling outcomes or over-explaining.

## When to Use

- Choice labels alone don't convey enough information
- Player needs to understand stakes or affordances to make informed decision
- Diegetic objects/terms need brief explanation
- Risk of player confusion without context

## When NOT to Use

- Choices are already clear and contrastive
- Context would spoil outcomes
- Explanation better belongs in Codex entry
- Micro-context would become mini-exposition

## Steps

### 1. Identify Ambiguity

- Read choice labels from player perspective
- Ask: Would I understand what each choice represents?
- Note: What information is missing?

### 2. Determine Minimal Information Needed

- What ONE piece of information would clarify the choice?
- Focus on affordances (what this enables) or stakes (what this risks)
- Avoid outcome prediction

### 3. Draft Micro-Context

- Keep to 1-2 lines maximum
- Place immediately before choices
- Use neutral, factual tone
- Maintain voice/register consistency

### 4. Validate Against Spoilers

- Does this reveal hidden information?
- Does this telegraph outcomes?
- If yes, defer to Codex entry or remove

## Examples

### Good Micro-Context

**Before:**
> "Take the hex-key" vs "Take the token"

**After:**
> The hex-key opens crew passages. The foreman's token grants access to secure zones.
>
> - Take the hex-key
> - Take the foreman's token

**Why It Works:** Clarifies affordances without spoiling what's in each area.

### Bad Micro-Context (Over-Explanation)

**Before:**
> "Move quickly" vs "Move carefully"

**After:**
> Moving quickly will let you reach the airlock before the crew, but you might trigger alarms. Moving carefully keeps you quiet, but the crew might beat you there. The airlock leads to the shuttle bay where you can find the evidence you need to expose the captain's conspiracy.

**Why It Fails:** Over-explains outcomes, spoils plot, too long.

### Bad Micro-Context (Spoiler)

**Before:**
> "Trust the engineer" vs "Investigate alone"

**After:**
> The engineer is actually working for the saboteurs, so trusting them might be dangerous.

**Why It Fails:** Spoils hidden allegiance.

## Principles

- **Minimal:** 1-2 lines maximum
- **Neutral:** Don't telegraph "correct" choice
- **Factual:** State affordances, not outcomes
- **Diegetic:** In-world language only
- **Player-Safe:** No spoilers, no internals

## Common Patterns

### Affordance Clarification

"The maintenance tunnel is narrow. The main corridor is patrolled."

### Object Description

"The datachip contains crew manifests. The keycard unlocks engineering."

### Stakes Without Outcomes

"Security is on high alert. The shift change happens in five minutes."

### Diegetic Terms

"Union tokens grant salvage rights. Freelance permits expire at dock."

## Outputs

- 1-2 lines of clarifying prose placed before choices
- Maintains section's voice and pacing

## Quality Bars Pressed

- **Accessibility:** Choices understandable to players
- **Presentation:** No spoilers in clarification

## Handoffs

- **To Codex Curator:** When clarification requires deeper explanation (create codex entry instead)
- **To Plotwright:** When ambiguity signals structural issue (choices too similar)
