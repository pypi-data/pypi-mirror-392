playbook_name: Style Tune-up
abbreviation: ST
version: 2.0.0
category: Refinement

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Detect and correct style drift across prose, captions, and PN surfaces without re-architecting the story. Tighten voice, register, motifs, and visual guardrails so the book reads like one mind made it."

outcome: "A consolidated style addendum with specific edit notes to owners, plus a green Presentation/Style pre-gate—ready for merge after downstream fixes."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "Readers/PN report tonal wobble or inconsistent diction"
    - "New chapter/act introduces variant tone needing harmonizing"
    - "Art/Audio plans landed and nudge aesthetics"
