# Paragraph cadence guideline
paragraph_cadence:
  default_target: 3  # paragraphs per full scene
  components:
    - "Lead image + motion (opening sensory details)"
    - "Goal/vector + friction (intent and obstacles)"
    - "Choice setup (context for decision)"

  micro_beat: 1  # paragraph for transit-only passages
  auto_extend: true  # If <3 paragraphs and not micro-beat, add movement/vector

# Drafting markers (not reader-facing)
drafting_markers:
  note: "Operational tempo markers are drafting aids ONLY, not reader-facing"
  examples:
    - name: "quick"
      use: "Metadata: pace: quick"
      not: "Header: ## Quick Intake"
    - name: "unofficial"
      use: "Metadata: route: unofficial"
      not: "Header: ## Unofficial Channel"

# Style self-check minimum
style_self_check:
  - "Register matches style guide"
  - "Paragraph voice consistent"
  - "Choices clear and contrastive"
  - "No meta phrasing in choices"
  - "PN-safe gateway hints (no codeword leaks)"
  - "Altered-hub returns: add unmistakable diegetic cue if needed"

# Escalation rules
escalation:
  human_question:
    - "Ambiguous tone direction (horror vs mystery?)"
    - "Scope uncertainty (expand beat or keep brief?)"
    - "Canon interpretation (how much to reveal now?)"

  role_wake:
    - "Style Lead: if major tone/register questions"
    - "Lore Weaver: if canon details needed for scene"
    - "Plotwright: if topology unclear for choice setup"
