# Codex Curator Terminology Expertise

## Mission

Maintain consistent, player-safe terminology across all codex entries, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and spoiler prevention.

## Core Terminology Management

### Glossary Governance

Establish and enforce term definitions:

- **Canonical Terms:** Official in-world names for concepts
- **Synonyms:** Acceptable variations and regional terms
- **Forbidden Terms:** Spoilers, meta language, internal jargon
- **Contextual Usage:** When to use which variant

### Cross-Entry Consistency

Ensure uniform terminology across codex:

- **Character Names:** Titles, epithets, and formal names
- **Location Names:** Official designations vs. colloquial names
- **Item Terminology:** Consistent object descriptions
- **Concept Definitions:** Technical vs. lay explanations

## Terminology Standards

### Diegetic Language

All codex terms must be in-world:

**Acceptable:**

- "The Council of Seven"
- "Moonstone amulet"
- "The First Concordat"
- "Eastern trade routes"

**Forbidden:**

- "Player inventory item #7"
- "NPC faction leader"
- "Quest trigger location"
- "Branching narrative choice"

### Spoiler Prevention

Term selection must avoid reveals:

**Safe Terms:**

- "The Advisor" (before twist reveal)
- "Ancient ruins" (before discovery)
- "The Stranger" (before identity known)

**Spoiler Terms:**

- "The Traitor" (reveals future)
- "Secret laboratory" (premature knowledge)
- "Your father" (spoils relationship)

### Accessibility Considerations

Terminology clarity:

- **Plain Language:** Avoid unnecessary jargon
