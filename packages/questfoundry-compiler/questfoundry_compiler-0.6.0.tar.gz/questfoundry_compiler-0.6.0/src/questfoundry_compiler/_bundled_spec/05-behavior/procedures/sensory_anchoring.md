# Sensory Anchoring

## Purpose

Embed sensory details (sight, sound, texture, smell, motion) in prose to ground scenes, enable Art/Audio planning, and provide Codex anchors—without revealing spoilers or twists.

## Why It Matters

- **Art Director:** Needs visual moments to select illustration slots
- **Audio Director:** Needs sound cues for ambience/foley planning
- **Codex Curator:** Uses concrete objects/places as entry anchors
- **Player Immersion:** Sensory details make world feel real

## Core Senses to Surface

- **Sight:** Colors, shapes, lighting, movement
- **Sound:** Ambience, voices, mechanical noises, silence
- **Touch/Texture:** Surfaces, temperature, weight, vibration
- **Smell:** (Use sparingly) Industrial, organic, atmospheric
- **Motion:** How things move, flow, shift

## Steps

### 1. Identify Anchor Opportunities

- Scene openings (establish setting)
- Action moments (surfaces motion and texture)
- Choice setup (grounds player in physical space)
- Key beats (memorable sensory moments)

### 2. Select Dominant Sense

- What's the primary sense for this moment?
- Sight for most scenes
- Sound for ambience-heavy or dialogue scenes
- Touch for tactile/action scenes

### 3. Add Supporting Details

- Layer 1-2 supporting senses
- Avoid sensory overload (3+ senses in one sentence)
- Maintain voice/register from Style Lead

### 4. Validate Against Spoilers

- Do these details reveal hidden information?
- Can Art use this without spoiling?
- Can Codex reference this safely?

## Examples

### Strong Sensory Anchoring

**Opening:**
> The maintenance deck hums with relay static. Dim LEDs stripe the bulkheads, painting long shadows between conduit runs. The deck plate thrums under your boots—something big is spinning below.

**Why It Works:**

- Sound: "hums with relay static"
- Sight: "Dim LEDs stripe the bulkheads"
- Touch: "deck plate thrums under your boots"
- Motion: "something big is spinning below"
- Provides hooks for Audio (relay hum), Art (striped lighting), Codex (maintenance deck)

### Weak Sensory Anchoring

**Opening:**
> You are in the maintenance deck. It's a room with equipment. You need to find the hex-key.

**Why It Fails:**

- No sensory details
- Generic description
- Doesn't enable Art/Audio planning
- No grounding for player

### Spoiler-Safe Anchoring

**Good:**
> The captain's quarters are quiet. A starmap glows on the desk, routes marked in blue and red.

**Bad:**
> The captain's quarters reveal evidence of the sabotage plot. Secret documents are hidden in the desk drawer, showing the captain's alliance with the pirates.

**Why Bad Version Fails:** Reveals hidden plot elements that should be discovered through gameplay.

## Sensory Patterns by Scene Type

### Action Scenes

- **Motion:** How things move, velocity, impact
- **Sound:** Clatter, impact, voices raised
- **Touch:** Effort, grip, recoil

### Discovery Scenes

- **Sight:** Details revealed, lighting changes
- **Sound:** Quiet ambience, contrast with silence
- **Touch:** Handling objects, textures

### Social Scenes

- **Sound:** Voice tones, crowd ambience
- **Sight:** Facial expressions, body language
- **Touch:** Proximity, tension

### Atmospheric Scenes

- **Sound:** Ambient layers, distant noises
- **Sight:** Lighting mood, scale
- **Touch:** Temperature, airflow

## Integration Points

### For Art Director

Surface visual moments:

- "The viewport frames the station's spinning ring"
- "Frost patterns web the airlock glass"
- "The cargo bay stretches three stories, crates stacked to darkness"

### For Audio Director

Surface sound cues:

- "The PA system crackles twice, then dies"
- "Hydraulics hiss as the door cycles"
- "Footsteps echo in the empty corridor"

### For Codex Curator

Surface concrete objects/places as anchor points:

- "The union token, stamped with the salvage guild's mark"
- "The maintenance hex-key, six-sided and worn"
- "The crew manifest board, names lit green and red"

## Outputs

- Sensory details embedded in section prose
- Hooks created for Art/Audio when iconic moments identified
- Concrete anchors for Codex entries

## Quality Bars Pressed

- **Style:** Sensory language matches register/voice
- **Presentation:** Details are player-safe, no spoilers

## Handoffs

- **To Art Director:** Flag iconic visual moments for illustration consideration
- **To Audio Director:** Flag sound-rich moments for cue planning
- **To Codex Curator:** Provide concrete objects/places for entry anchors

## Common Issues

- **Sensory Overload:** Too many senses in one sentence
- **Generic Details:** "It's dark" vs "Shadows pool between the crates"
- **Spoiler Leak:** Visual details that telegraph twists
- **Inconsistent Voice:** Sensory language drifts from Style register
