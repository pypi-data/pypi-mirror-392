# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Decide what to illustrate and why, then (optionally) produce illustrations that match style and narrative intent—without leaking spoilers. This loop supports plan-only merges when the Illustrator is dormant."

outcome: "An Art Plan (subjects, purpose, composition intent, captions, constraints) and, if active, art renders with determinism notes. Ready for Gatekeeper checks and merge to Cold (plans may merge as deferred; renders merge only on full pass)."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "New chapter/act needs anchoring visuals"
    - "Scene gained iconic imagery (after Story Spark / Scene Smith pass)"
    - "Style Lead requests motif reinforcement"
    - "Replacement or upgrade of an existing illustration"
    - "Export goal includes art plan/renders"
  tu_format: "tu-art-<scope>"
  showrunner_decision: "Confirm Art Director/Illustrator activation; they may be dormant individually"

# RACI assignments
raci:
  responsible:
    - role: "@adapter:art_director"
      responsibilities: "Select scenes/subjects; state purpose; write composition intent and spoiler-safe captions; specify constraints"
    - role: "@adapter:illustrator"
      responsibilities: "If active: produce renders; iterate to intent; log determinism parameters if promised"
  accountable:
    - role: "@adapter:showrunner"
      responsibilities: "Sets scope; decides plan-only vs render; sequences merge"
  consulted:
    - role: "@adapter:style_lead"
      responsibilities: "Ensure visual language matches register/motifs; flag drift"
    - role: "@adapter:gatekeeper"
      responsibilities: "Check Presentation Safety, Style, and Determinism (when applicable)"
  informed:
    - role: "@adapter:codex_curator"
      responsibilities: "Ensure captions stay player-safe"
    - role: "@adapter:player_narrator"
      responsibilities: "Receives art for reference during narration (surface wording stays safe)"

# Inputs
inputs:
  - "Current Cold snapshot (canon, codex, style guardrails)"
  - "Target sections/scenes (Hot drafts acceptable for planning)"
  - "Lore Deepening notes (spoiler flags), Codex entries (player-safe wording)"
  - "Accessibility and PN considerations (alt text patterns, diegetic references)"

# Core procedures
procedures:
  primary:
    - "@procedure:illustration_slot_selection"
    - "@procedure:art_plan_authoring"
    - "@procedure:visual_language_maintenance"
  supporting:
    - "@procedure:artifact_validation"
    - "@procedure:spoiler_hygiene"
    - "@procedure:art_determinism_planning"
    - "@procedure:alt_text_creation"
    - "@procedure:determinism_logging"

# Merge options
merge_options:
  plan_only: "Plans merge as deferred without rendering"
  full_pass: "Plans + renders merge together"

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Art Plans specify purpose, composition, captions (player-safe), alt guidance"
  - "If renders: match plan intent; determinism logged off-surface"
  - "No spoilers in captions or alt text"
  - "Visual language consistent with Style register/motifs"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # No internals/technique; spoiler-safe captions/alt
    - accessibility  # Alt guidance concrete; captions don't contradict text
  secondary:
    - style          # Visual language consistent with register
    - determinism    # Logs off-surface when promised

# Handoffs
handoffs:
  to_illustrator:
    content: "Art plans for rendering"
    condition: "If Illustrator active"

  to_gatekeeper:
    content: "Plans and renders for Presentation and Accessibility checks"
