# Continuity Check (Quick Reference)

Before finalizing canon, verify:

**Referential Integrity:**

- [ ] All entity references resolve to existing canon/codex
- [ ] All location references defined in topology
- [ ] All event references in timeline
- [ ] No broken links or orphaned artifacts

**Timeline Coherence:**

- [ ] Timeline anchors consistent (no paradoxes)
- [ ] Events in plausible sequence
- [ ] Character ages/lifespans make sense
- [ ] Historical references align with chronology

**Invariants:**

- [ ] No contradictions with world rules
- [ ] Character behavior consistent with traits
- [ ] Faction motivations align with prior canon
- [ ] Social/cultural rules maintained

**Cross-Role Alignment:**

- [ ] Canon aligns with Plotwright's topology
- [ ] Canon supports Scene Smith's prose
- [ ] Canon respects Style Lead's register

**If conflicts detected:**

- Document specific contradictions
- Propose reconciliations
- Mark deliberate mysteries with bounds
- Escalate unresolvable conflicts to Showrunner
