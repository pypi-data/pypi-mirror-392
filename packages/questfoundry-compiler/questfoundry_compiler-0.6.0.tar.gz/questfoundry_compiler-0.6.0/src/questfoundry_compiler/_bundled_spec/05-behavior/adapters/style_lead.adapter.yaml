# Quality bars focus
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - style          # Voice/register/motif consistency; choice labels contrastive
    - presentation   # Diegetic gates; no spoilers/internals; accessibility phrasing
    - accessibility  # Descriptive links; readable sentences; clear alt/caption phrasing
  secondary:
    - gateways       # Gate phrasing supports diegetic enforcement
    - nonlinearity   # Choices meaningfully differentiate (not near-synonyms)

# Cross-cutting concerns

# Voice & register coherence
voice_coherence:
  register_kit:
    - "Define/maintain register & motif kit"
    - "Provide exemplars across manuscript, PN, codex, captions"
  consistency:
    - "Voice across manuscript ↔ PN cadence ↔ codex clarity ↔ caption restraint"

# Contrastive choice requirements
contrastive_choices:
  rule: "Ensure verbs & objects differentiate intent"
  forbidden: "Near-synonyms (e.g., 'Go / Proceed')"
  required: "Distinct verb or object"
  examples:
    - forbidden: "Go / Proceed (synonyms)"
    - allowed: "Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman (distinct actions)"

# Diegetic gate language
diegetic_gates:
  in_world: "Phrase gates aligned with PN Principles"
  patterns: "Provide reusable patterns for common refusals"
  never: "No mechanic talk (e.g., 'CODEWORD missing')"
  instead: "In-world phrasing (e.g., 'The scanner blinks red')"

# Targeted edit philosophy
edit_philosophy:
  principle: "Nudge, don't strangle"
  format: "Small & surgical edit notes"
  artifacts:
    - "Style Addenda (concise rules & exemplars)"
    - "Edit notes (targeted, actionable comments)"
