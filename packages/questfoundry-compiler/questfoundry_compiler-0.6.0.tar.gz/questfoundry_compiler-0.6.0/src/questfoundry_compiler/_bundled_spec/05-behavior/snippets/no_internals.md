# No Internals

## Core Principle

Player-facing surfaces must contain ONLY in-world content. All production internals, mechanics, and tooling details stay off-surface.

## Forbidden on Surfaces

### Codeword Names

✗ "OMEGA_CLEARANCE"
✗ "FLAG_FOREMAN_TRUST"
✗ "CODEWORD_RELAY_HUM"

✓ Use in-world equivalents: "security clearance", "foreman's approval", "relay access"

### Gate Logic

✗ "if FLAG_X then..."
✗ "requires OMEGA and DELTA"
✗ "check: reputation >= 5"

✓ Use diegetic cues: "scanner blinks red", "foreman shakes head", "access denied"

### Seeds/Models

✗ "Generated with DALL-E using seed 1234"
✗ "Claude Opus 4.0"
✗ "Midjourney v6"

✓ Store in off-surface determinism logs only

### Tooling Mentions

✗ "DAW: Logic Pro"
✗ "VST: Reverb Plugin X"
✗ "Recorded at 24bit/96kHz"

✓ Store in off-surface production logs only

### Production Metadata

✗ "Draft v3"
✗ "TODO: Fix this gate"
✗ "Approved by: @alice"

✓ Keep in Hot comments or off-surface logs

## Role-Specific Applications

**Player-Narrator:**

- CRITICAL enforcement during performance
- No codeword names
- No gate logic
- No seeds/models
- No tooling mentions

**Gatekeeper:**

- Block surfaces containing internals
- Validate Cold Manifest for internal leakage
- Require diegetic substitutions

**Style Lead:**

- Supply in-world alternatives for meta language
- Ban technique references in style addenda
- Ensure motif kit uses world terms

**Book Binder:**

- Strip production metadata during export
- No meta markers in navigation
- Validate front matter player-safe

## Detection Patterns

### Codeword Detection

- All-caps identifiers (OMEGA, FLAG_X)
- Underscore-separated (FOREMAN_TRUST)
- Prefix patterns (FLAG_, CODEWORD_, CHECK_)

### Logic Detection

- Conditional syntax (if/then, requires, check:)
- Operators (>=, AND, OR)
- Variable references ($reputation, @state)

### Technique Detection

- Tool names (DALL-E, Claude, Midjourney, Logic Pro)
- Technical specs (24bit, 96kHz, seed 1234)
- Plugin/VST names

### Meta Detection

- Version indicators (v3, draft, final)
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Attribution (@username, approved by)

## Safe Alternatives

**Instead of Codewords:**

- Use descriptive in-world terms
- Example: "security badge" not "CLEARANCE_OMEGA"

**Instead of Gate Logic:**

- Use environmental cues
- Example: "The lock stays red" not "requires FLAG_X"

**Instead of Technique:**

- Use atmospheric description
- Example: "Frost webs the viewport" not "Generated with seed 1234"

**Instead of Meta:**

- Omit entirely from player surfaces
- Store in Hot workspace or off-surface logs

## Validation

- Grep for all-caps identifiers
- Search for conditional keywords (if, requires, check)
- Scan for tool/software names
- Review for TODO/FIXME comments
- Check image metadata stripped
- Verify audio captions technique-free
