playbook_name: Translation Pass
abbreviation: TP
version: 2.0.0
category: Asset

# Purpose and outcome
purpose: "Create or update a player-safe translation of the manuscript/codex surfaces while preserving PN boundaries, style intent, and navigation. This loop supports plan-only merges (glossary/style kit) when the full slice isn't ready."

outcome: "A Language Pack (glossary, style notes, localized surfaces, open issues) ready for Gatekeeper checks and merge to Cold. Exports can include complete or partial translations flagged accordingly."

# Activation criteria
activation_criteria:
  triggers:
    - "New target language requested"
    - "Significant style/canon changes warrant a translation refresh"
    - "Accessibility or market goals require multilingual exports"
  tu_format: "tu-translation-<lang>-<scope>"
  showrunner_decision: "Confirm Translator activation (others may be dormant)"

# RACI assignments
raci:
  responsible:
    - role: "@adapter:translator"
      responsibilities: "Produce Language Pack: glossary, style transfer notes, localized surfaces; flag untranslatables and cultural risks"
  accountable:
    - role: "@adapter:showrunner"
      responsibilities: "Scope completeness (chapters only, full book, codex subset) and merge timing"
  consulted:
    - role: "@adapter:style_lead"
      responsibilities: "Approve register mapping (formal/informal 'you'), motif equivalence, idiom strategy"
    - role: "@adapter:player_narrator"
      responsibilities: "Validate diegetic gate phrasing patterns in target language; no internals exposed"
    - role: "@adapter:codex_curator"
      responsibilities: "Ensure cross-refs and titles localize consistently; avoid spoiler drift"
    - role: "@adapter:gatekeeper"
      responsibilities: "Check Presentation Safety, Integrity (links resolve), Style adherence"
  informed:
    - role: "@adapter:book_binder"
      responsibilities: "Includes translated slices in exports with coverage flags"

# Inputs
inputs:
  - "Cold snapshot (manuscript/codex surfaces), PN Principles, Style guardrails"
  - "Current glossary/terminology (if any); motif kit"
  - "Cultural notes from Lore/Style (tone, registers to preserve/avoid)"
  - "Known untranslatable idioms list (if exists)"

# Core procedures
procedures:
  primary:
    - "@procedure:language_pack_production"
    - "@procedure:register_map_maintenance"
    - "@procedure:terminology_coordination"
  supporting:
    - "@procedure:artifact_validation"
    - "@procedure:spoiler_hygiene"

# Language pack components
language_pack_components:
  - "Glossary (bilingual, with variants)"
  - "Style transfer notes (register map, idiom strategy)"
  - "Localized surfaces (manuscript/codex slices)"
  - "PN phrasing patterns (target language)"
  - "Open issues (untranslatables, cultural risks)"
  - "Coverage report (% complete, gaps documented)"

# Coverage tracking
coverage_tracking:
  levels:
    - complete     # Full coverage
    - partial      # Flagged gaps with fallback policy
    - plan-only    # Glossary and style kit only
  reporting: "Coverage % stated; gaps documented with fallback policy"

# Register mapping
register_mapping:
  considerations:
    - "Formal/informal 'you' (tu/vous, tú/usted)"
    - "Slang and colloquialisms"
    - "POV distance"
    - "Motif equivalence"
    - "Idiom portability"

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Glossary complete with bilingual terms and variants"
  - "Style register mapped with exemplars"
  - "Localized surfaces retain PN boundaries (no spoilers/internals)"
  - "Diegetic gate phrasing preserved in target language"
  - "Coverage % stated; gaps flagged with safe fallbacks"
  - "Cross-refs and navigation resolve correctly"

# Quality bars pressed
quality_bars:
  primary:
    - presentation   # No internals; retain source spoiler restraint
    - accessibility  # Descriptive links; readable sentences; adapted punctuation
    - style          # Register/terminology align with Style/Curator
  secondary:
    - integrity      # Anchors resolve after binding; no orphan labels
    - gateways       # Gates remain diegetic in target language
