Boxes is a collection of tools for making TUI python projects.

## Dependencies

Boxes uses curses, with comes with python, so nothing must be installed additionally

## How to use

### Setup

First you will have to import the package:

```python
from boxes_tui import TUI
```

Now you will need to create a new TUI object intance:

```python
my_tui = TUI()
```

After that you can use the tools that this package supplies.

### Curses Wrapper

It is adviced to use the curses wrapper. It supports error handling, in the case your program terminates before calling:

```python
my_tui.cleanup()
```

To use the wrapper you will have to import:

```python
from curses import wrapper
from boxes_tui import TUI
```

Change your main function to take in the parameter ```stdsrc```:

```python
def main(srdsrc):
```

and call it using:

```python
wrapper(main)
```

You will also need to construct the TUI opject with ```stdsrc```:

```python
my_tui = TUI(stdsrc)
```

### Tool usage

See [example.py](https://github.com/IamLegende7/boxes-tui/blob/main/examples/example.py) for a basic TUI script example.

1. Menu

    **Creation**

    This simple menu is navigatable by arrow keys and enter.

    You have to pass in the lable and a function to execute; all in a list.

    Here is an example for a super basic menu:

    ```python
    my_menu = tui.Menu(stdscr, [("Hello", tui.nothing), ("Quit", quit_app)])
    ```

    Here the entrys get stored as a list of tuples of ```(label, function_to_call)```


    As you can see, you also put in a window. Its values (aka the origin coord and the height & width) will be used for the Menu.

    You can chage them later using:

    ```python
    my_menu.chage_values(x, y, width, height)
    ```

    **Ticking**

    Ticking refreshes the menu and processes keypresses. For values it returns, see Returns

    You can tick the function using:

    ```python
    my_menu.tick(key)
    ```

    ```key``` can be gotten by using:

    ```python
    key = stdsrc.getch()
    ```

    **Keybinds**

    You can set the Menu's keybinds by passing in a keybinds list:

    ```python
    my_menu = tui.Menu(stdscr, 
                       [("Hello", tui.nothing), ("Quit", quit_app)], 
                       [([curses.KEY_UP, ord("W"), ord("w")], tui.Menu.move_up),
                        ([curses.KEY_DOWN, ord("S"), ord("s")], tui.Menu.move_down),
                        ([10], tui.Menu.select) # (10 = Enter key)
                       ]
                    )
    ```

    The default keybindings are:

    ```python
    [
        ([curses.KEY_UP], tui.Menu.move_up),
        ([curses.KEY_DOWN], tui.Menu.move_down),
        ([10, curses.KEY_RIGHT], tui.Menu.select),
        ([curses.KEY_BACKSPACE, curses.KEY_LEFT], tui.Menu.back)
    ]
    ```

    **Returns**

    When ticking, the menu may (when the user presses "enter" or "backspace") return a tuple of ```(index, return_of_the_function)```

    Were ```index``` is the index of the entry the user selected. -1 if the user pressed backspace.

    ```return_of_the_function``` is whatever the function may have returned, that has been called by the menu.
