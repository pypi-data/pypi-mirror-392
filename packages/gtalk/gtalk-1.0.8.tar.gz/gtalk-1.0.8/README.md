## Configuration

GTalk uses headless Chrome by default. The browser session is reused across queries for better performance.

## Troubleshooting

### CAPTCHA Detected

If you see "Google has detected automated access":

- Wait a few minutes between queries
- Use a VPN or different network
- Reduce query frequency

### No Summary Found

If no AI summary is returned:

- Try rephrasing your query
- Use question format: "What is...", "How to...", "Explain..."
- Some queries may not trigger AI Mode

## Privacy & Rate Limiting

- GTalk makes direct requests to Google
- No data is stored or logged by this tool
- Respect Google's rate limits - avoid excessive automated queries
- Consider delays between queries if using programmatically
