# duet

A simple future-based async library for python

Duet takes inspiration from the amazing [trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
library and the [structured concurrency](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
approach to async programming that it uses.
However, duet differs from trio in two major ways:

- Instead of a full-blown implementation of asynchronous IO, duet relies  on the
  `Future` interface for parallelism, and provides a way to run async/await
  coroutines around those `Future`s. This is useful if you are using an API that
  returns futures, such as RPC libraries like gRPC. The standard `Future`
  interface does not implement `__await__` directly, so `Future` instances must
  be wrapped in `duet.AwaitableFuture`.

- duet is re-entrant. At the top level, you run async code by calling
  `duet.run(foo)`. Inside `foo` suppose you call a function that has not yet
  been fully refactored to be asynchronous, but itself calls `duet.run(bar)`.
  Most async libraries, including `trio` and `asyncio`, will raise an exception
  if you try to "re-enter" the event loop in this way, but duet allows it. We
  have found that this can simplify the process of refactoring code to be
  asynchronous because you don't have to completely separate the sync and async
  parts of your codebase all at once.
