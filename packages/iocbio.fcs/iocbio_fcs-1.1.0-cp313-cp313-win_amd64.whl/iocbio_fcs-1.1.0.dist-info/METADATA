# IOCBIO FCS: A Unified Platform for FCS and RICS Analysis with Advanced Statistical Inference

**IOCBIO FCS** is an open-source Python-based platform for analyzing fluorescence intensity traces and images obtained from Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) experiments.

This software provides a complete workflow from data visualization and autocorrelation calculation to model fitting and parameter estimation.


The software package includes Python libraries and command-line interface tools that enable users to:

- Visualize individual fluorescence trace/image and averaged traces/images across multiple measurements.  
- Calculate the autocorrelation function (ACF) for both FCS traces and RICS images using GPU/CPU acceleration.  
- Fit ACF data with flexible diffusion models to estimate diffusion coefficients and other parameters, using both nonlinear least-squares (NLS) and Bayesian approaches.  
- Plot results including fitted ACF data, pre-analysis scatter plots, posterior diagnostics, angular dependence plots in RICS, and spatially resolved parameter maps from sector analysis.
