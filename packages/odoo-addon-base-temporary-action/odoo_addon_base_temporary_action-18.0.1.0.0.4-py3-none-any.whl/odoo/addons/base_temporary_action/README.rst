This module is a technical module that does nothing by itself.

This addon allows to create temporary actions that will be removed
automatically after one hour (default transient age limit). Temporary
actions are identified by a field 'is_temporary'.

Use Cases / Context
===================

We wanted to be able to open a new quotation form (without creating it
in the database) with default values coming from an external system
using a GET route and redirect.

We couldn't find a way to pass our values to a new quotation form using
Odoo standard. That's why we created this module: it allows us to create
a temporary action that we delete after it is used. On this action, we
add context that allows us to get the default values on the new
quotation.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

- Create an action, either by code or in the user interface and set its
  field is_temporary to True.
- You have one hour to use your action (default transient age limit).
