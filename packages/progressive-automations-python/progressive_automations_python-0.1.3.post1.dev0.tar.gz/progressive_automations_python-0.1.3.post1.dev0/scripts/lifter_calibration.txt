# Desk Lifter Calibration Data

Lowest height: 23.7 inches
Highest height: 54.5 inches

Down movement rate: 0.55 inches/second (measured from 54.5" to 49" in 10s)
Up movement rate: 0.55 inches/second (measured from 23.7" to 29.1" in 10s)

Calibration measurements:
- Down 10s: 54.5" → 49.0"
- Up 10s: 23.7" → 29.1"

Notes:
- Use these rates to estimate time needed to reach a target height from the lowest position.
- Rates may vary slightly; repeat measurements for higher accuracy if needed.
