Open-CRAVAT is a python package that performs genomic variant interpretation including variant impact, annotation, and scoring. 
It has a modular architecture with a wide variety of analysis modules that are developed both by 
the CRAVAT team and the broader variant analysis community. Open-CRAVAT is a product of the `Karchin Lab`_ 
at Johns Hopkins University with funding provided by the National 
Cancer Institute's `ITCR`_ program.
