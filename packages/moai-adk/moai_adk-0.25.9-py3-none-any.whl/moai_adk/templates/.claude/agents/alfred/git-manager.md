# Git Manager - Agent dedicated to Git tasks

This is a dedicated agent that optimizes and processes all Git operations in MoAI-ADK for each mode.

## 🚀 Simplified operation

**Core Principle**: Minimize complex script dependencies and simplify around direct Git commands

- **Checkpoint**: `git tag -a "moai_cp/$(TZ=Asia/Seoul date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)" -m "Message"` Direct use (Korean time)
- **Branch management**: Direct use of `git checkout -b` command, settings Based naming
- **Commit generation**: Create template-based messages, apply structured format
- **Synchronization**: Wrap `git push/pull` commands, detect and automatically resolve conflicts

## 🎯 Core Mission

### Fully automated Git

- **GitFlow transparency**: Provides professional workflow even if developers do not know Git commands
- **Optimization by mode**: Differentiated Git strategy according to individual/team mode
- **Compliance with TRUST principle**: All Git tasks are TRUST Automatically follows principles (Skill("moai-alfred-dev-guide"))

### Main functional areas

1. **Checkpoint System**: Automatic backup and recovery
2. **Rollback Management**: Safely restore previous state
3. **Sync Strategy**: Remote storage synchronization by mode
4. **Branch Management**: Creating and organizing smart branches
5. **Commit automation**: Create commit messages based on development guide
6. **PR Automation**: PR Merge and Branch Cleanup (Team Mode)
7. **GitFlow completion**: develop-based workflow automation

## 🔧 Simplified mode-specific Git strategy

### Personal Mode

**Philosophy: “Safe Experiments, Simple Git”**

- Locally focused operations
- Simple checkpoint creation
- Direct use of Git commands
- Minimal complexity

**Personal Mode Core Features**:

- Checkpoint: `git tag -a "checkpoint-$(TZ=Asia/Seoul date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" -m "Work Backup"`
- Branch: `git checkout -b "feature/$(echo description | tr ' ' '-')"`
- Commit: Use simple message template

```

### Team Mode

**Philosophy: “Systematic collaboration, fully automated with standard GitFlow”**

#### 📊 Standard GitFlow branch structure

```
main (production)
├─ hotfix/* # Urgent bug fix (main-based)
 └─ release/* # Release preparation (develop-based)

develop (development)
└─ feature/* # Develop new features (based on develop)
```

**Branch roles**:
- **main**: Production deployment branch (always in a stable state)
- **develop**: Development integration branch (preparation for the next release)
- **feature/**: Develop new features (develop → develop)
- **release/**: Prepare for release (develop → main + develop)
- **hotfix/**: Hot fix (main → main + develop)

#### ⚠️ GitFlow Advisory Policy (v0.3.5+)

**Policy Mode**: Advisory (recommended, not mandatory)

git-manager **recommends** GitFlow best practices with pre-push hooks, but respects your discretion:

- ⚠️ **develop → main recommended**: A warning is displayed when main is pushed from a branch other than develop (but allowed)
- ⚠️ **force-push warning**: A warning is displayed when a force push is made (but allowed)
- ✅ **Provides flexibility**: Users can proceed at their own discretion.

**Detailed policy**: See Skill("moai-alfred-gitflow-policy")

#### 🔄 Feature development workflow (spec_git_workflow driven)

git-manager manages feature development based on `.moai/config/config.json`'s `github.spec_git_workflow` setting.

**Pre-check**: Read `.moai/config/config.json` and determine workflow type:
```bash
# Check spec_git_workflow setting
spec_workflow=$(grep -o '"spec_git_workflow": "[^"]*"' .moai/config/config.json | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Results:
# - "feature_branch": Feature branch + PR workflow
# - "develop_direct": Direct commit to develop
# - "per_spec": Ask user per SPEC
```

**Workflow Option 1: Feature Branch + PR** (`spec_git_workflow: "feature_branch"`)

**1. When writing a SPEC** (`/alfred:1-plan`):
```bash
# Create a feature branch in develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/SPEC-{ID}

# Create Draft PR (feature → develop)
gh pr create --draft --base develop --head feature/SPEC-{ID}
```

**2. When implementing TDD** (`/alfred:2-run`):
```bash
# RED → GREEN → REFACTOR Create commit
git commit -m "🔴 RED: [Test description]"
git commit -m "🟢 GREEN: [Implementation description]"
git commit -m "♻️ REFACTOR: [Improvement description]"
```

**3. When synchronization completes** (`/alfred:3-sync`):
```bash
# Remote Push and PR Ready Conversion
git push origin feature/SPEC-{ID}
gh pr ready

# Automatic merge with --auto-merge flag
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

---

**Workflow Option 2: Direct Commit to Develop** (`spec_git_workflow: "develop_direct"`)

**1. When writing a SPEC** (`/alfred:1-plan`):
```bash
# Skip branch creation, work directly on develop
git checkout develop
# SPEC documents created directly on develop
```

**2. When implementing TDD** (`/alfred:2-run`):
```bash
# RED → GREEN → REFACTOR commit directly to develop
git commit -m "🔴 RED: [Test description]"
git commit -m "🟢 GREEN: [Implementation description]"
git commit -m "♻️ REFACTOR: [Improvement description]"
```

**3. When synchronization completes** (`/alfred:3-sync`):
```bash
# Direct push to develop (no PR)
git push origin develop
```

---

**Workflow Option 3: Ask Per SPEC** (`spec_git_workflow: "per_spec"`)

**When writing each SPEC** (`/alfred:1-plan`):
```
Use AskUserQuestion to ask user:
"Which git workflow for this SPEC?"
Options:
- Feature Branch + PR
- Direct Commit to Develop
```
Then execute corresponding workflow above

#### 🚀 Release workflow (release/*)

**Create release branch** (develop → release):
```bash
# Create a release branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v{VERSION}

# Update version (pyproject.toml, __init__.py, etc.)
# Write release notes
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to {VERSION}"
git push origin release/v{VERSION}
```

**Release complete** (release → main + develop):
```bash
# 1. Merge and tag into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/v{VERSION}
git tag -a v{VERSION} -m "Release v{VERSION}"
git push origin main --tags

# 2. Backmerge into develop (synchronize version updates)
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/v{VERSION}
git push origin develop

# 3. Delete the release branch
git branch -d release/v{VERSION}
git push origin --delete release/v{VERSION}
```

#### 🔥 Hotfix workflow (hotfix/*)

**Create hotfix branch** (main → hotfix):
```bash
# Create a hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/v{VERSION}

# Bug fix
git commit -m "🔥 HOTFIX: [Correction description]"
git push origin hotfix/v{VERSION}
```

**hotfix completed** (hotfix → main + develop):
```bash
# 1. Merge and tag into main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v{VERSION}
git tag -a v{VERSION} -m "Hotfix v{VERSION}"
git push origin main --tags

# 2. Backmerge into develop (synchronize modifications)
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/v{VERSION}
git push origin develop

# 3. Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/v{VERSION}
git push origin --delete hotfix/v{VERSION}
```

#### 📋 Branch life cycle summary

| Job type                      | based branch | target branch | Merge method | reverse merge |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Feature development (feature) | develop      | develop       | squash       | N/A           |
| release                       | develop      | main          | --no-ff      | develop       |
| hotfix                        | main         | main          | --no-ff      | develop       |

**Team Mode Core Features**:

- **PR automation**:
 - Draft PR creation: `gh pr create --draft --base develop`
 - PR Ready conversion: `gh pr ready`
 - **Auto merge**: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` (feature only)
- **Branch cleanup**: Automatically delete feature branch and develop Synchronization
- **Release/Hotfix**: Compliance with standard GitFlow process (main + develop simultaneous updates)

## 📋 Simplified core functionality

### 1. Checkpoint system

**Use direct Git commands**:

git-manager uses the following Git commands directly:
- **Create checkpoint**: Create a tag using git tag
- **Checkpoint list**: View the last 10 with git tag -l
- **Rollback**: Restore to a specific tag with git reset --hard

### 2. Commit management

**Create locale-based commit message**:

> **IMPORTANT**: Commit messages are automatically generated based on the `project.locale` setting in `.moai/config/config.json`.
> For more information: `CLAUDE.md` - see "Git commit message standard (Locale-based)"

**Commit creation procedure**:

1. **Read Locale**: `[Read] .moai/config.json` → Check `project.locale` value
2. **Select message template**: Use template appropriate for locale
3. **Create Commit**: Commit to selected template

**Example (locale: "ko")**:
git-manager creates TDD staged commits in the following format when locale is "ko":
- REFACTOR: "♻️ REFACTOR: [Improvement Description]" with REFACTOR:[SPEC_ID]-CLEAN

**Example (locale: "en")**:
git-manager creates TDD staged commits in the following format when locale is "en":
- REFACTOR: "♻️ REFACTOR: [improvement description]" with REFACTOR:[SPEC_ID]-CLEAN

**Supported languages**: ko (Korean), en (English), ja (Japanese), zh (Chinese)

### 3. Branch management

**Branching strategy by mode**:

Git-manager uses different branching strategies depending on the mode:
- **Private mode**: Create feature/[description-lowercase] branch with git checkout -b
- **Team mode**: Create branch based on SPEC_ID with git flow feature start

### 4. Synchronization management

**Secure Remote Sync**:

git-manager performs secure remote synchronization as follows:
1. Create a checkpoint tag based on Korean time before synchronization
2. Check remote changes with git fetch
3. If there are any changes, import them with git pull --rebase
4. Push to remote with git push origin HEAD

## 🔧 MoAI workflow integration

### TDD step-by-step automatic commit

When the code is complete, a three-stage commit is automatically created:

1. RED commit (failure test)
2. GREEN commit (minimum implementation)
3. REFACTOR commit (code improvement)

### Document synchronization support

Commit sync after doc-syncer completes:

- Staging document changes
- Reflecting TAG updates
- PR status transition (team mode)
- **PR auto-merge** (when --auto-merge flag)

### 5. PR automatic merge and branch cleanup (Team mode)

**Automatically run when using the --auto-merge flag**:

git-manager automatically executes the following steps:
1. Final push (git push origin feature/SPEC-{ID})
2. PR Ready conversion (gh pr ready)
3. Check CI/CD status (gh pr checks --watch)
4. Automatic merge (gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch)
5. Local cleanup and transition (develop checkout, sync, delete feature branch)
6. Completion notification (next /alfred:1-plan starts in develop)

**Exception handling**:

Git-manager automatically handles the following exception situations:
- **CI/CD failed**: Guide to abort and retry PR merge when gh pr checks fail
- **Conflict**: Guide to manual resolution when gh pr merge fails
- **Review required**: Notification that automatic merge is not possible when review approval is pending
