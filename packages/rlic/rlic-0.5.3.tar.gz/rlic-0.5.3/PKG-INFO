***Line Integral Convolution for Python, written in Rust***

`rLIC` (pronounced 'relic') is a highly optimized, minimal implementation of the
[Line Integral
Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral_convolution) algorithm
for in-memory `numpy` arrays, written in Rust.

## Development status

`rLIC` is currently in beta. As of version 0.5.0, the only public API,
`rlic.convolve`, is considered feature complete and stable. However, minor
behavior changes may still happen, particularly where performance can be
improved as a result. The library as a whole may still grow additional APIs,
which wouldn't immediately be marked as stable.

## Free-threading support

`rlic.convolve` is trivially thread-safe, because it does not mutate any external
data. As of version 0.5.1, Wheels are not yet distributed for free-threaded
CPython, but this build target is still supported and tested.

## Installation
```
python -m pip install rLIC
```

## Examples

`rLIC` consists in a single Python function, `rlic.convolve`, that convolves a
`texture` image (usually noise) with a 2D vector field described by its
components `u` and `v`, via a 1D `kernel` array. The result is an image where
pixel intensity is strongly correlated along field lines.

Let's see an example. We'll use `matplotlib` to visualize inputs and outputs.
```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import rlic

SHAPE = NX, NY = (256, 256)
prng = np.random.default_rng(0)

texture = prng.random(SHAPE)
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, NY)
U = np.broadcast_to(np.cos(2 * x), SHAPE)
V = np.broadcast_to(np.sin(x).T, SHAPE)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(10, 5))
for ax in axs:
    ax.set(aspect="equal", xticks=[], yticks=[])

ax = axs[0]
ax.set_title("Input texture (noise)")
ax.imshow(texture)

ax = axs[1]
ax.set_title("Input vector field")
Y, X = np.mgrid[0:NY, 0:NX]
ax.streamplot(X, Y, U, V)
```

</p>

Now let's compute some convolutions, varying the number of iterations
```py
kernel = 1 - np.abs(np.linspace(-1, 1, 65))

fig_out, axs_out = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(15, 5))
for ax in axs_out:
    ax.set(aspect="equal", xticks=[], yticks=[])
for n, ax in zip((1, 5, 100), axs_out, strict=True):
    image = rlic.convolve(
        texture,
        U,
        V,
        kernel=kernel,
        boundaries="periodic",
        iterations=n,
    )
    ax.set_title(f"Convolution result ({n} iteration(s))")
    ax.imshow(image)
```

</p>

## Polarization mode

By default, the direction of the vector field affects the result. That is, the
*sign* of each component matters. Such a vector field is analogous to a velocity
field. However, the sign of `u` or `v` may sometimes be irrelevant, and only
their absolute directions should be taken into account. Such a vector field is
analogous to a polarization field. `rLIC` supports this use case via an
additional keyword argument, `uv_mode`, which can be either `'velocity'`
(default), or `'polarization'`. In practice, the difference between these two
modes in only visible around sharps changes in sign in either `u` or `v`, and
with certain kernels.
Let's illustrate one such case

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import rlic

SHAPE = NX, NY = (256, 256)
prng = np.random.default_rng(0)

texture = prng.random(SHAPE)
kernel = 1 - np.abs(np.linspace(-1, 1, 65, dtype="float64"))

U0 = np.ones(SHAPE)
ii = np.broadcast_to(np.arange(NX), SHAPE)
U = np.where(ii<NX/2, -U0, U0)
V = np.zeros((NX, NX))

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=3, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(15, 5))
for ax in axs:
    ax.set(aspect="equal", xticks=[], yticks=[])

ax = axs[0]
ax.set_title("Input vector field")
Y, X = np.mgrid[0:NY, 0:NX]
ax.streamplot(X, Y, U, V)

for uv_mode, ax in zip(("velocity", "polarization"), axs[1:], strict=True):
    image = rlic.convolve(
        texture,
        U,
        V,
        kernel=kernel,
        uv_mode=uv_mode,
        boundaries={"x": "periodic", "y": "closed"},
    )
    ax.set_title(f"{uv_mode=!r}")
    ax.imshow(image)
```

</p>


## Memory Usage

`rLIC.convolve` allocates exactly two buffers with the same size as `texture`,
`u` and `v`, regardless of the number of `iterations` performed, one of which is
discarded when the function returns. This means that peak usage is about 5/3 of
the amount needed to hold input data in memory, and usage drops to 4/3 on
return.
