PREAMBLE
Nikolaos Tsapanos (Tax Identification / VAT Number EL104216536) - (hereinafter
referred to as the “Developer”) provides software under the name “GeoND”,
hereinafter referred to as “GeoND” or “(the) Library”.
The Library is a collection of custom operations and additional functions for
the training and operation of neural networks and is currently available for
the PyTorch and TensorFlow software packages. The custom operations are meant
to either replace existing layers in network architectures, or be additionally
inserted into said architectures, in order to increase the performance, or
speed of the neural network. In some cases, these custom operations require
specific functions during the training of the network, which are included in
the Library.
The Library is available in several versions (as defined under Appendix_I),
each with distinct features. This Agreement applies to all such versions and
lays out the specifics for each version.
These license terms are an agreement between the Developer and you (the
“Client”). Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which
includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to
any:
    * subsequent version of the software (including any updates or
      supplements),
    * Internet-based services, and
    * support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms
apply.
By purchasing a License for and/or using the software, you accept these terms.
If you don’t accept them, do not purchase a License for and/or use the
software.
As described below, installation or use of the software also operates as your
consent to the transmission of certain standard computer information during
validation, automatic download and installation of certain updates, and for
Internet-based services.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights and obligations
below.

      of the Library for the purpose of cross-checking such data against the
      corresponding License details in order to verify its use according to the
      terms of this Agreement. The Developer retains the right, and the Client
      consents thereto, both during the identification process and for the
      entire term of the License, to electronically retrieve— including through
      the use of the Library itself—data relating to the version of the
      Library, its operating environment, the functionalities used, and its use
      in general for the purpose of verifying the use of the Library in
      accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In case of breach of the
      terms of this Agreement by the Client, the Developer may terminate this
      Agreement, effective immediately, and also render the non-free features
      of the Library inoperable.

consequential, indirect, actual, special, exemplary, or otherwise). In any case
and under any circumstances, the Developer’s liability shall always be limited
to the lowest extent permitted by law and the Developer shall never be liable
for anything other than gross negligence.
8.4
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Client may recover from the
Developer only direct damages up to a hundred euros (100,00€). The Client can’t
recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special,
indirect or incidental damages. This limitation applies to:
  (a)
      anything related to the software, services, content (including code); and
  (b)
      claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
      condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort.
    * It also applies even if the Developer knew or should have known about the
      possibility of the damages.
9  DURATION / BREACH OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
9.1
The duration of this Agreement shall be agreed on a case-by-case basis, i.e. at
the point in time that the Client makes an online purchase of the License.
9.2
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Developer may at any time
terminate this Agreement, even without cause, provided a written termination
notice is given, which will take effect thirty (30) days thereafter. In this
case, the portion of outstanding Instances will, at the Developer’s sole
discretion, be either refunded to the Client or the Client shall be given a one
(1) month period in order to use such outstanding Instances.
10  FINAL PROVISIONS
10.1
The parties commit to acting in good faith and not engaging in the abusive
exercise of their rights arising from this Agreement.
10.2
Any partial or total invalidity of a provision of this Agreement shall not
affect the validity of the remaining provisions. The parties agree to legally
replace any invalid provision with a valid one that closely approximates the
economic or other purpose of the invalid provision.
10.3
This Agreement, along with its Appendixes, which form an integral part of it,
constitutes the complete agreement on its subject matter and supersedes any
prior negotiations, commitments, or understandings. The Developer may amend
this Agreement from time to time by posting an amended version on the Website
and sending Client written notice thereof. Such amendment will become effective
seven (7) days after such notice. In any case, Client’s continued use of GeoND
after such seven (7) days’ notice period will confirm Client’s consent to such
amendment.
10.4
The non-enforcement of any term does not constitute a waiver of that term.
10.5
The parties acknowledge and accept that all terms of this Agreement are fair
and reasonable, and they explicitly and irrevocably declare that they enter
into this Agreement of their own free will.
10.6
This Agreement is governed by Greek law, and any dispute regarding the
interpretation or application of its terms, as well as any conflict arising
from it, is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of

Appendix I  The license tiers
  1.
      Full License (Standard & Premium)
      The Full License gives access to the Full Library, which includes the
      best available implementations of the forward and backward passes of the
      custom operations and the additional functions. In order to train a
      neural network with the custom operations, both the forward and backward
      passes are required.
  2.
      Academic License (Standard & Premium)
      The Academic License is identical, in terms of operations and functions,
      to the Full License, i.e. it gives access to the Full Library (Standard &
      Premium, respectively) but without the right of commercial use and is
      only available for academic institutions and students at a significantly
      lower price.
  3.
      Free License
      The Free License gives access to the Free Library, which is a redacted
      version of the Full Library, i.e. includes potentially slower
      implementations of the forward and backward passes of the custom
      operations and functions and may be missing some features of the Full
      Library.
      The Free License does not include the right for commercial use.
      The Free Library includes / gives access to Updates but at a later date
      than the Full Library (Standard & Premium).
  4.
      Inference License (Standard & Premium)
      The Inference License gives access to the Inference Library, which
      includes the forward pass functions of the Full Library (Standard &
      Premium, respectively). The Inference Library is meant to be deployed in
      products and services, in order to operate already trained neural
      networks.
 Standard vs Premium License
  (I)
      Standard License
      The Standard License of GeoND might have fewer features than the Premium
      Version but all features in common shall have the same performance.
      Moreover, licensees of the Standard Version shall also have access to
      certain scientific research / articles of the Developer, albeit such
      access might be made available after it has become available to licensees
      of the Premium Version.
      The Standard Version of GeoND shall include / give access to Updates but
      at a later date than the Premium.
  (II)
      Premium License
      The Premium License of GeoND includes all the features available at the
      best performance available as well as Updates.
      Moreover, licensees of the Premium Version shall also have access to
      certain scientific research / articles of the Developer before these are
      made available to anyone else.
      The Premium License shall be the first to get updates.
Attention: The duration of any Premium License is for two (2) years but if the
Client does not renew such Premium License every year, then the second (2nd)
year License shall be downgraded to Standard License. More information of the
features of the various License Tiers is available on the Website.
Appendix II  License Fee
As specified, and amended from time to time, on the Website.
Appendix III  Definitions
For the purposes of this Agreement (as defined below), unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
“E-Mail Support” means electronically generated Support Services provided in
response to electronically transmitted inquiries by Licensee.
“Issue” means an error, question, or other issue related to GeoND for which
Client needs Support Services assistance. Developer provides Support Services
for Issues that are reproducible, GeoND running unaltered, and on an
appropriate hardware, database and operating system configurations, as
specified by Developer.
“Update(s)” means revisions to GeoND that correct defects, errors or bugs or
incorporate minor enhancements to the functionality that Developer in its
discretion makes generally available to its clients. Developer will notify
Client of all Updates available for GeoND. Developer will make such Updates and
corresponding documentation available to Client at no additional cost.
“Instance(s)” means the number of times the software is loaded on an electronic
device’s memory in order to be executed, i.e. the number of copies of the
software that are activated on an electronic device’s memory. For example, the
software is used for training artificial intelligence models, in which case:
    * Training of one (1) model on one (1) GPU equals one (1) instance.
    * Training of two (2) models on one (1) GPU equals two (2) instances.
    * Training of one (1) model on three (3) GPUs equals three (3) instances.
    * Training of two (2) models on four (4) GPUs equals eight (8) instances.
“Website” means “https://geond.tech”.

shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
”Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes
of this definition, ”submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including
but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code
control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf
of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
writing by the copyright owner as ”Not a Contribution.”
”Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-
exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-
exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
of this License; and
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
You changed the files; and
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any
part of the Derivative Works; and
(d) If the Work includes a ”NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then
any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an ”AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to
use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/
or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend,
and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
warranty or additional liability.
