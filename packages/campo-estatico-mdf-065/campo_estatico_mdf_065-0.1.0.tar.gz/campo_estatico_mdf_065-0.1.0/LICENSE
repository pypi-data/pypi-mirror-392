                       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
 and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors. You can use it for
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
 you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs,
 and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
 rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
 you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
 versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.
 This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
 freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse
 occurs in the area of products for individual use, which is precisely
 where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version
 of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems
 arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this
 provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 make special effort to protect free software's operation, so that patent
 holders do not render the program nonfree.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
 the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
 infringement, such as reproducing, running, publicly displaying,
 publicly performing, or selling it. Excluded from propagation is the
 mere interaction with a user through a computer network, without transfer
 of a copy.

 An "interactive user interface" means an interface where common and
 reasonable legal notices should appear, if the work has one.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and
 to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or generally
 available tools or commercially available reference programs which are
 used un modified in performing those activities but which are not part of
 the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
 files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
 shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
 specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
 or control flow between those subprograms.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
 work.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a
 work.

 A "System Library" means any library, other than the Program's
 compiler or kernel, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
 a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and
 (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or
 to implement a standard interface for which the work is written. A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a full operating system, such
 as Debian GNU/Linux, its major components, and the associated utilities.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code and
 to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or generally
 available tools or commercially available reference programs which are
 used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of
 the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition
 files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
 shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
 specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication
 or control flow between those subprograms.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
 work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent rights, as provided by copyright
 law.

 You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not propagate,
 without condition.

 You may propagate covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
 them install them on your behalf, provided that you comply with the
 License in propagating all the material that you provide to them. You
 must make sure that they have access to install and run those copies.

 3. Exercising Patent and Trademark Rights.

 The grant of rights under this License includes the right to make, use,
 sell, offer for sale, and import the Program and derivative works
 in all countries where the Program is covered by patent claims.
 The grant of rights is contingent upon your compliance with the
 terms of this License. If you violate any of the terms of this
 License, your rights under this License terminate automatically.

 If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program or
 a covered work infringes its patent rights, then any patent licenses
 granted to you by this License for that Program or covered work
 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added to those of this License apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
 you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
 of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
 and giving a relevant date.

 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
 released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
 This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
 all notices".

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
 to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
 therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
 to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
 packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any
 other way, but it does not invalidate permission you might have for
 works other than the covered work.

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
 'Appropriate Legal Notices'; however, if the Program has interactive
 interfaces that do not display 'Appropriate Legal Notices', your work
 need not make them do so.

 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and the aggregate are not used to
 control the storage or distribution medium. The aggregate does not
 bring the other works under the scope of this License.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source
 in one of the ways specified below:

 a) Convey the object code in a fixed physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium) containing the Corresponding Source
 fixed in a durable physical medium, in a medium customarily used for
 software interchange.

 b) Convey the object code in a fixed physical product (including a
 physical distribution medium) that usually contains the software and
 is accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years,
 to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
 Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered
 by this License, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
 network server at no charge.

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
 written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is
 allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received
 the object code with such an offer.

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
 (e.g., a network server) to copy the object code and to copy the
 Corresponding Source, or equivalent means, at no charge, or at a
 price no more than your reasonable cost of performing this service.
 If conveying the object code includes support or warranty protection,
 you may offer to convey the Corresponding Source to users at a
 price no more than that service's share of your total cost of the
 software.

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
 you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source
 are available, or equivalently, at a price no more than your
 reasonable cost of performing this service.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions must be stated in the form of a separately written
 document, or in the form of exceptions made in the Program's source code,
 and must be accompanied by the Corresponding Source.

 "Non-permissive additional terms" are terms that prohibit the exercise
 of a right otherwise granted by this License. "Permissive additional
 terms" are terms that grant additional permission or rights.

 If you convey a covered work with an interactive user interface, you
 must display the 'Appropriate Legal Notices', as defined in section 8,
 when the user interacts with the work.

 If you convey a covered work that you received under this License, you
 may attach additional terms that do not contradict this License.
 For example, you may add non-permissive additional terms to the
 work's Corresponding Source that preclude the use of the work, or
 any modification thereof, in any circumstances, where such
 non-permissive terms would violate this License.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify
 a covered work is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
 under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
 second paragraph of section 10).

 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless the copyright holder has explicitly and finally terminated your
 license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify
 you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to one year after
 the cessation.

 Furthermore, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder gives you explicit
 permission to do so.

 This section does not affect the operation of section 6.

 9. Acceptance.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
 accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
 work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 An "entity transaction" is a transaction in which control of an
 organization is transferred, or a transaction involving a transfer of
 substantially all the assets of an organization, or a change in the
 form of the organization. If propagation of a covered work results
 from an entity transaction, the recipient of the covered work
 automatically receives a license under this License for the work that
 that entity transaction transferred.

 11. Patent License Termination.

 If you convey a covered work, you implicitly grant a patent license to
 the recipient that covers all of your patent claims that are necessary
 to make, use, sell, offer for sale, and import the covered work. The
 patent license granted under the preceding sentence terminates on the
 date the recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 the covered work infringes its patent rights.

 12. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR THE DISTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE
 FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
 SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR
 BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
 WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE
 OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE,
 EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

 13. General Provisions.

 This License is subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 provided that the terms of this License are not substantially
 different from the terms of this License, as reasonably interpreted by
 the Free Software Foundation. If the terms of this License are
 substantially different, the terms of this License are deemed void.

 14. Interpretation.

 If this License is terminated, all sections of this License that
 reasonably should survive termination, including, but not limited to,
 sections 10, 11, and 12, shall survive termination.

 15. Entire Agreement.

 This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
 and understandings, whether oral or written.

 16. Waiver.

 Any waiver of the terms of this License must be in writing and signed
 by the party to be charged with the waiver.

 17. Severability.

 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
 the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 18. Governing Law.

 This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of California,
 without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

 19. Notice of Copyright.

 You must provide all recipients of the Program with a notice of copyright
 on the Program, in a form that is reasonably accessible and easy to
 understand. The notice must include the following information:
 (1) the name of the copyright holder; (2) the year the Program was first
 published; (3) the year the Program was last modified; (4) the license
 under which the Program is distributed; and (5) a statement that the
 Program is distributed without any warranty, express or implied.

 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    Copyright (C) <año>  <nombre del autor>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

 If the program does have interactive user interfaces, you should make sure
 that they display an appropriate legal notice.

 If the program is modularized, you should include a notice on the
 top-level module stating that the program is released under the GNU
 General Public License.

 If you have modularized your program into separate modules, each module
 should include the full text of this License, or a pointer to where
 the full text is found.
