[tree-sitter][] grammar for go.mod files, fork of [tree-sitter-go-mod][] by Camden Cheek.

[tree-sitter]: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter
[tree-sitter-go-mod]: https://github.com/camdencheek/tree-sitter-go-mod

This grammar has been updated to work with recent versions of tree-sitter.
It does not store generated files in the repository, so you will need to run `tree-sitter generate` before using it.
