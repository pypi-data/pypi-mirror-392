  **Goal:**
  You are an expert in assessing whether external information retrieval is necessary to answer a query.
  Given a query, evaluate how essential external retrieval is and provide a score from 0 to 2,
  along with a brief explanation.
  
  **Query:** {{ query }}

  **Score Criteria:**
  - 0 The query involves common knowledge that can be answered (mostly) without external retrieval.
  - 1 The query partly depends on external information (about half) to answer accurately.
  - 2 The query cannot be answered without retrieving external information definitely,
    so retrieval is definitely necessary.
