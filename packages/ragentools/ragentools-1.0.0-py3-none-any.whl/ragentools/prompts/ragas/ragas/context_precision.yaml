  You are an expert evaluator for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
  Your task is to assess how *precisely relevant* the retrieved contents are to the given user question.

  ### User Question:
  {{ question }}

  ### Retrieved Text:
  {{ retrieved_text }}

  ### Evaluation Guidelines:
  1. **Context Precision** means the degree to which the retrieved text is directly relevant and specific to answering the question.
  2. Irrelevant or only tangentially related information lowers precision.
  3. Redundant but relevant information does not lower precision.
  4. Missing information is not penalized here — only the presence of irrelevant or noisy context matters.

  ### Scoring Criteria:
  - **5 (Excellent):** All retrieved content is highly relevant and directly supports answering the question.
  - **4 (Good):** Most content is relevant, with only minor unrelated details.
  - **3 (Fair):** About half of the content is relevant; noticeable noise or unrelated parts.
  - **2 (Poor):** Mostly irrelevant or generic content.
  - **1 (Bad):** Almost completely unrelated to the question.

  ### Output Format:
  Give your answer in JSON:
  {
    "score": [1-5],
    "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why the score was given."
  }
