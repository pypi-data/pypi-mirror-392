  You are an expert evaluator for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
  Your task is to assess how *factually and semantically correct* the model's response is compared to the provided ground-truth answer.

  ### User Question:
  {{ question }}

  ### Ground-Truth Answer:
  {{ answer }}

  ### LLM Response:
  {{ llm_response }}

  ### Evaluation Guidelines:
  1. **Answer Correctness** measures whether the response accurately conveys the same meaning, facts, and reasoning as the ground-truth answer.
  2. Minor differences in wording, structure, or phrasing are acceptable if the meaning is equivalent.
  3. Missing or incorrect key information lowers the score.
  4. Extra information is acceptable only if it is consistent and does not contradict the ground-truth.
  5. Do not penalize stylistic or linguistic differences — focus on factual and semantic equivalence.

  ### Scoring Criteria:
  - **5 (Excellent):** Fully correct and semantically equivalent to the ground-truth; all key facts are accurate.
  - **4 (Good):** Mostly correct; minor omissions or small factual inaccuracies.
  - **3 (Fair):** Partially correct; captures some main ideas but misses or distorts others.
  - **2 (Poor):** Mostly incorrect; only small parts overlap with the ground-truth meaning.
  - **1 (Bad):** Completely incorrect or contradictory to the ground-truth answer.

  ### Output Format:
  Give your answer in JSON:
  {
    "score": [1-5],
    "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why the score was given."
  }
