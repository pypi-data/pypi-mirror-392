  You are an expert RAG system advisor.
  Below are the average evaluation scores for a generated response.
  The scores are on a scale from {{ min_score }} to {{ max_score }}, the higher the better.

  {{ avg_score_dict }}

  Task: Provide **detailed and actionable suggestions** to improve the system's performance.
  Focus on the areas with lower scores, but also offer general tips to improve overall quality.

  Guidelines:
  1. Analyze the scores and identify the weak points.
  2. For each weak metric, explain why it may be low and give **specific steps** to improve it.
  3. Give practical suggestions for improving the **retrieval system**, the **LLM response generation**, or **alignment between retrieval and generation**.
  4. Keep suggestions clear, structured, and actionable — ideally in bullet points.
  5. Avoid generic advice like “improve the model”; instead, target precise improvements (e.g., enhance retrieval coverage, reduce hallucinations, paraphrase handling, etc.)
