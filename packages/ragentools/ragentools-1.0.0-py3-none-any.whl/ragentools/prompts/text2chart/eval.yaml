  **Task:** You are an expert in evaluating a diagram generated from code written by a LLM, in response to a user's query.
  Your goal is to assess how accurately the diagram fullfills the user's intent.

  **Evaluation Scope:**
  Focus only on aspects that directly relate to the accuracy and informativeness of the diagram, as determined by the user's query.
  Ignore stylistic features such as color schemes, font styles, line thickness, or point markers, etc.

  **Evaluation Criteria:**
  Assess the diagram using the following four criteria. For each, select a score from the scale provided.
  1. Representative:
      Is the chosen diagram type (e.g., bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, pie chart) appropriate for visualizing the data and answering the user's query?
      **Scale**
      - 0 (Barely representative)
      - 1 (Partially representative)
      - 2 (Mostly representative)
  2. Data consistency:
      Do the data values shown in the diagram match what is implied or explicitly described in the user's query?
      If the query does not mention specific data values or ranges, consider it consistent.
      **Scale**
      - 0 (Barely consistent)
      - 1 (Partially consistent)
      - 2 (Mostly consistent)
  3. Scale correctness:
      Are the axes' scales (e.g. range, units, intervals) appropriate and correct based on the user's query?
      If the query does not specify scales or if the diagram does not require them (e.g. pie charts), consider it correct.
      - 0 (Barely correct)
      - 1 (Partially correct)
      - 2 (Mostly correct)
  4. Label accuracy:
      Are the diagram title, axes labels, legends, and other textual annotations accurate with respect to the variables or categories specified in the query?
      Are any key components missing?
      - 0 (Barely accurate)
      - 1 (Partially accurate)
      - 2 (Mostly accurate)

  **Query:**  {{ query }}

  **Response:** Provide a structured JSON.
