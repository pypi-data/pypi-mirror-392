  **Goal:**
  You are an expert in query completion and enhancement for information retrieval.
  Given a query and a suggestion describing the missing or inadequate parts,
  generate a list of refined queries that fully covers the intended information need.
  Do NOT need to preserve all parts of the original query — focus on the improve parts instead.

  **Guidelines:**
  - The refined query should be self-contained and ready for retrieval (complete sentence).
  - Avoid repeating, irrelevant or redundant parts from the suggestion.
  - Subquestions should complete different aspects and do not overlap in meaning.
  - If there is only one aspect to improve, just return a list with that single refined query.

  **Query:**  {{ query }}
  
  **Suggestion:** {{ suggestion }}
