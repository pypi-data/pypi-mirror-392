  You are an expert evaluator for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
  Your task is to assess how *relevant and directly responsive* the model's answer is to the given user question.

  ### User Question:
  {{ question }}

  ### LLM Response:
  {{ llm_response }}

  ### Evaluation Guidelines:
  1. **Answer Relevance** measures how directly and appropriately the response addresses the user's question.
  2. Responses that are on-topic, coherent, and directly answer the question receive higher scores.
  3. Irrelevant, off-topic, overly general, or evasive responses lower the score.
  4. The factual accuracy or support from retrieved context is *not* evaluated here — focus only on how well the response fulfills the user's query.

  ### Scoring Criteria:
  - **5 (Excellent):** Fully relevant and directly answers the question; clear and complete.
  - **4 (Good):** Mostly relevant; minor omissions or slight digressions.
  - **3 (Fair):** Partially relevant; somewhat related but incomplete or partially off-topic.
  - **2 (Poor):** Mostly irrelevant or vague; only weakly related to the question.
  - **1 (Bad):** Completely irrelevant or nonsensical response.

  ### Output Format:
  Give your answer in JSON:
  {
    "score": [1-5],
    "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why the score was given."
  }
