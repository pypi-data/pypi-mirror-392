  You are an expert evaluator for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
  Your task is to assess how *faithfully* the model's response aligns with and is supported by the retrieved text.

  ### Retrieved Text:
  {{ retrieved_text }}

  ### LLM Response:
  {{ llm_response }}

  ### Evaluation Guidelines:
  1. **Faithfulness** measures whether the response strictly relies on information present in the retrieved text.
  2. The response should not introduce unsupported claims, fabricate facts, or contradict the retrieved information.
  3. Paraphrasing or summarizing the retrieved content is acceptable as long as meaning is preserved.
  4. Missing details are not penalized here — only the presence of incorrect or hallucinated information.

  ### Scoring Criteria:
  - **5 (Excellent):** Entire response is fully supported by the retrieved text; no hallucination or contradiction.
  - **4 (Good):** Mostly supported; only minor inferred or ambiguous statements.
  - **3 (Fair):** Some parts are supported, but there are noticeable unsupported or speculative statements.
  - **2 (Poor):** Largely unsupported; several claims cannot be verified by the retrieved text.
  - **1 (Bad):** Completely unfaithful; response contradicts or ignores the retrieved information.

  ### Output Format:
  Give your answer in JSON:
  {
    "score": [1-5],
    "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why the score was given."
  }
