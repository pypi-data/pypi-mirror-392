  You are an expert evaluator for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
  Your task is to assess how *completely* the retrieved chunks include the information from the ground-truth answer.

  ### Ground-Truth Answer:
  {{ answer }}

  ### Retrieved Text:
  {{ retrieved_text }}

  ### Evaluation Guidelines:
  1. **Context Recall** measures the extent to which the retrieved text includes the key information from the ground-truth answer.
  2. Paraphrased or semantically equivalent information counts as present.
  3. Missing or absent information lowers the recall score.
  4. Irrelevant or extra content does not affect the score — focus only on coverage of the ground-truth answer.

  ### Scoring Criteria:
  - **5 (Excellent):** All key information from the ground-truth answer is present in the retrieved contents.
  - **4 (Good):** Most key information is included; minor details are missing.
  - **3 (Fair):** About half of the key information is present.
  - **2 (Poor):** Only a small portion of the ground-truth information is included.
  - **1 (Bad):** Almost none of the ground-truth information appears in the retrieved contents.

  ### Output Format:
  Give your answer in JSON:
  {
    "score": [1-5],
    "reason": "Brief explanation (1-2 sentences) describing why the score was given."
  }
