# Advent of Code Module

[![aoc-mod](https://github.com/cosmos1255/aoc_mod/actions/workflows/build_wheel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cosmos1255/aoc_mod/actions/workflows/build_wheel.yml)

A library for Advent of Code containing utilities to use while solving problems!

If any issues or bugs are discovered, please submit an issue and I'll fix it!

## Install and use the CLI `aoc-mod`

```sh
pip install aoc-mod
```

## Run the `aoc-mod` script

To enable full functionality of this script, set an environment variable named `SESSION_ID` with your authenticated session ID from the browser (see [getting and using the session ID](#getting-and-using-the-session_id)).

```sh
# access the help menu
aoc-mod -h

# optional: set the session ID to enable full functionality
# on Linux:
export SESSION_ID=[session-id]
# on Windows:
set SESSION_ID=[session-id]

# get puzzle instructions and set up a Python file for solving for the current day
aoc-mod setup

# setup the project for a specific day
aoc-mod -y 2024 -d 2 setup

# submit a challenge (2024, day 2, part A)
aoc-mod -y 2024 -d 2 submit -a [answer] -p 1
```

## Installation with Poetry for development

The build system has been updated to utilize poetry for installation, building, and dependency management. To install/build locally, install the poetry build system through `pipx`.

```sh
# install pipx
sudo apt install pipx

# install poetry
pipx install poetry
```

Once poetry is installed, the following commands can be used to install, build, and run unit tests locally.

```sh
# install the library
poetry install

# build a wheel
poetry build

# run the tests
poetry run pytest
```

Formatting and linting is also available through `ruff`.

```sh
# run a linter check
poetry run ruff check

# run a linter check and correct issues
poetry run ruff check --fix

# format the code
poetry run ruff format
```

Some vulnerability scanning is also available with `bandit`.

```sh
poetry run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r .
```

## Documentation

The documentation is managed and built using Sphinx through the Poetry build system. To build the documentation and open it, run the following commands:

```bash
poetry run sphinx-build -M html docs/source/ docs/build/
firefox docs/build/html/index.html
```

## Getting and Using the SESSION_ID

The `SESSION_ID` is necessary to perform advanced operations like getting puzzle input and
submitting puzzle answers. Without this variable, the only operations available are getting basic
puzzle instructions and setting up a solution template file.

| Feature | `session-id` | no `session-id` |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Get puzzle instructions | full support | partial support |
| Get puzzle input | full support | no support |
| Submit puzzle solutions | full support | no support |
| Setup puzzle solution folder | full support | full support |

In order to obtain this variable, authenticate with <https://adventofcode.com> and then press `F12` in the browser and navigate to the Application or Storage Tabs, if they exist, and search the cookies for the `session` or `sessionid` value.

**NOTE: The session id value is a unique key for your own authenticated session with Advent of Code. You should protect it like a password and never share it (i.e. never push a session id to GitHub or store in an insecure location).**
