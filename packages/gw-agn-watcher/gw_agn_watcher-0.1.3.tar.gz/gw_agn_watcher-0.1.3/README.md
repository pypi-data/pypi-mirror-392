### Overview

**`gw_agn_watcher`** is a Python package for the **automated crossmatching of gravitational-wave (GW) sky maps** from the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration with **optical transient alerts and AGN catalogs**.  
It enables systematic searches for **electromagnetic counterparts** to compact binary mergers, with a particular focus on mergers that may occur in **active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks**.

---

### Key Features

- 📡 **Ingest LVK skymaps** (`.fits`, HEALPix format)
- 🌌 **Crossmatch ZTF alerts** with AGN catalogs (e.g., Milliquas, Pan-STARRS)
- 🧠 **Apply ML-based filters** using ALeRCE classifiers, Pan-STARRS morphology, and Deep Real/Bogus scores
- 📅 **Temporal and spatial filtering** relative to the GW trigger time and sky localization
- 🎯 **Host-galaxy association** and ranking based on 2σ GW distance posteriors
- 🗺️ **Visualization tools** for probability maps, candidate locations, and sky coverage
- 🔧 **Modular and extensible** — suitable for ToO planning, multi-messenger analyses, and survey follow-up

### Installation

```bash
pip install gw-agn-watcher
