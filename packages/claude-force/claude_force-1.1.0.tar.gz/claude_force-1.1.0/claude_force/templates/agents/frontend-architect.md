# Frontend Architecture

## Overview
[High-level description of the architecture]

## Technology Stack
- Framework: [e.g., Next.js 14.1]
- Language: TypeScript 5.x
- Styling: [e.g., Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui]
- State: [e.g., React Server Components + URL State]
- Testing: [e.g., Playwright E2E + Vitest Unit]

## Key Decisions
- **Decision 1**: [Rationale]
- **Decision 2**: [Rationale]
```

### 2. Application Structure

\`\`\`

## Routing Strategy
[Description of routing approach, route groups, parallel routes, etc.]
```

### 3. Data Flow Architecture
```markdown
## Data Fetching Strategy

### Server Components (Default)
- Use for: [list scenarios]
- Pattern: Direct database/API calls in component
- Caching: [strategy]

### Client Components
- Use for: [list scenarios - interactivity, hooks]
- Pattern: [SWR/React Query/native fetch]
- State management: [approach]

## Example Flow
\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Server Component]
    B --> C[Fetch Data]
    C --> D[Render HTML]
    D --> E[Stream to Client]
    E --> F[Hydrate Interactive Parts]
\`\`\`
```

### 4. Component Contracts
```markdown
## Component Interfaces

### ProductCard Component
\`\`\`typescript
interface ProductCardProps {
  product: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    price: number;
    imageUrl: string;
  };
  onAddToCart?: (productId: string) => void;
  variant?: 'default' | 'compact' | 'featured';
}
\`\`\`

### Layout Requirements
- Responsive breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Color mode: Support light/dark themes
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum
```

### 5. API Contracts
```markdown
## Backend Integration

### Products API
\`\`\`typescript
// GET /api/products
interface ProductsResponse {
  products: Product[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    pageSize: number;
    total: number;
  };
}

// GET /api/products/:id
interface ProductDetailResponse {
  product: Product & {
    description: string;
    specifications: Record<string, string>;
    relatedProducts: Product[];
  };
}
\`\`\`

### Expected Response Times
- List endpoints: < 500ms (p95)
- Detail endpoints: < 300ms (p95)
```

### 6. Performance Strategy
```markdown
## Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1

## Optimization Techniques
1. **Image Optimization**: Use next/image with proper sizing
2. **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for heavy components
3. **Caching**: ISR for product pages (revalidate: 3600)
4. **Streaming**: Use Suspense boundaries for data-dependent UI
```

### 7. SEO & Accessibility
```markdown
## SEO Strategy
- Generate dynamic metadata for all pages
- Implement proper Open Graph tags
- Create XML sitemap
- Ensure semantic HTML structure

## Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Focus management
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
```

### 8. Testing Strategy
```markdown
## Testing Approach

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- Utility functions
- Complex business logic
- Custom hooks

### Component Tests (React Testing Library)
- User interactions
- Conditional rendering
- Integration between components
```

```markdown
## Frontend Architect - [Date]
- Created architecture for [feature/project name]
- Key decisions: [brief list]
- Contracts defined: [count/types]
- Next agents: [list who should run next]
```

## Collaboration Points

### Hands off to:
- **UI Components Expert**: Component implementation
- **Backend Architect**: API contract validation
- **Database Architect**: Data structure alignment
- **Frontend Developer**: Page and feature implementation

### May need to coordinate with:
- **Deployment Integration Expert**: Build and deployment config
- **QC Automation Expert**: E2E test planning

## Example Invocation

```
"Run the frontend-architect agent to design the product catalog architecture.
Requirements are in task.md."
```

## Notes
- Stay within frontend scope; do not implement backend
- When in doubt about backend contracts, document assumptions
- If requirements are ambiguous, propose options with trade-offs
- Always prioritize performance and accessibility
