# Task: Build Product Catalog UI

**Created**: 2025-11-13
**Owner**: Product Team
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Feature

**Assigned Agent(s)**: Full-stack workflow (see workflow section below)
**Suggested Workflow**: `full-stack-feature`

## Objective

Create a server-side rendered product catalog page for an e-commerce flower shop. The catalog should display flower arrangements in a responsive grid with filtering by category, price range, and occasion. This feature is critical for Q4 launch and needs to handle 10,000+ products efficiently.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Display products in responsive grid layout (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
- Filter by category (Roses, Tulips, Arrangements, Gifts)
- Filter by price range ($0-50, $50-100, $100-200, $200+)
- Filter by occasion (Birthday, Wedding, Sympathy, Anniversary)
- Search functionality with real-time results
- Product cards show image, name, price, rating
- Click product card to navigate to detail page

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Initial page load < 2s, filter updates < 500ms
- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000 products without pagination lag
- **Security**: No XSS vulnerabilities in search
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering for all product pages

### Technical Requirements
- **Stack**: Next.js 14.1 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x + shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- **State**: Server Components for data, URL state for filters
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E + Vitest unit tests

---

## Context

### Background
Our current catalog is client-side rendered and performs poorly with large datasets. Customer feedback indicates slow load times and poor SEO rankings. This redesign will use Next.js 14 Server Components for better performance and SEO.

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers (< 2 years old)
- Database can be restructured if needed
- Product images are optimized and served via CDN
- Backend API supports filtering and pagination

### Constraints
- **Time**: Must complete by December 1, 2025
- **Budget**: No additional infrastructure costs
- **Technical**: Must integrate with existing Stripe checkout
- **Business**: Cannot change pricing display logic

### Dependencies
- Product image CDN setup (complete)
- PostgreSQL database with product data (complete)
- Stripe integration for checkout (existing)

## Workflow

**Suggested agent sequence**:

1. **frontend-architect** - Define architecture, routing, component structure
2. **database-architect** - Design indexes for product queries
3. **backend-architect** - Design filter/search API endpoints
4. **ui-components-expert** - Build ProductCard, FilterBar, SearchBox
5. **frontend-developer** - Implement catalog page with server components
6. **qc-automation-expert** - Create E2E and unit tests
7. **deployment-integration-expert** - Configure Vercel deployment

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| 10K products slow down filters | High | Medium | Implement database indexes, use pagination |
| Search overwhelms database | High | Low | Add rate limiting, use search indexes |
| Images slow page load | Medium | High | Use Next.js Image optimization, lazy loading |
| Browser compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Cross-browser testing in CI/CD |
