## 🔌 MCP Integration (Claude Desktop)

Connect the bot to Claude Desktop for AI-powered interactions.

### Setup (3 minutes)

**1. Create MCP configuration:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Windows
notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**2. Add configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "assistant-bot": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "src.web.server_stdio"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/assistant-bot"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Replace the path:**
```bash
# Get your project path
pwd
# Copy the output and paste it in the config above
```

**4. Restart Claude Desktop**

### Running MCP Server

The MCP server can run in two modes:

**Automatic (via Claude Desktop):**
When you configure Claude Desktop as shown above, it automatically starts the MCP server when needed. No manual action required.

**Manual (for testing):**
You can also run the MCP server manually for testing or development:

```bash
# Run MCP server in stdio mode (for Claude Desktop integration)
python3 -m src.web.server_stdio

# Or run the standalone MCP server
python3 -m src.web.server
```

The server will start and wait for connections. Use Ctrl+C to stop it.

### Using with Claude

Now you can control the bot through Claude:

```
You: "Add a contact named Sarah with phone 555-1234"
Claude: I'll add that contact for you
Result: Contact added successfully

You: "Show all my contacts"
Claude: Here are your contacts: ...

You: "Create a note: Call Sarah tomorrow"
Claude: Note created with ID: ...
```

### Available MCP Tools (39 total)

- All contact management functions
- All note operations
- Search and filtering
- Tag management
- Birthday tracking

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### NLP Mode Issues

**Problem**: Models not loading
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and re-download
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main --nlp
```

**Problem**: Out of memory
```bash
# Solution: Use classic mode or increase RAM
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main  # Classic mode uses <100MB
```

### Database Issues

**Problem**: Database schema errors
```bash
# Solution: Delete old database (data will be lost)
rm ~/.assistant-bot/data/addressbook.db
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main
```

### MCP Issues

**Problem**: Claude Desktop can't find bot
```bash
# Solution 1: Check path in config
pwd  # Copy this exact path to claude_desktop_config.json

# Solution 2: Use absolute path
"cwd": "/Users/yourname/path/to/assistant-bot"

# Solution 3: Test stdio manually
python3 -m src.web.server_stdio
```
