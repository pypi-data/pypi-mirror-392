              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# wiki3-ai

Python wrapper for Chrome's built-in AI Prompt API, enabling direct access to browser-provided language models from Jupyter notebooks.

## Features

- 🤖 Direct access to Chrome's built-in AI via the Prompt API
- 📓 Seamless Jupyter integration using AnyWidget
- 🔄 Bidirectional communication via traitlets
- 🎯 Type-safe Python API matching the Web IDL specification
- 🌊 Support for streaming responses
- 🛠️ Tool use capabilities
- 🖼️ Multimodal input support (text, images, audio)
- 📊 Session management and cloning
- 🔒 Privacy-focused on-device processing

## Installation

```bash
pip install wiki3-ai
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Chrome browser with Prompt API enabled
- Running in a Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)

## Quick Start

```python
from wiki3_ai import LanguageModel

# Create a language model session
session = await LanguageModel.create()

# Simple prompt
result = await session.prompt("Write me a poem about Python.")
print(result)

# Streaming response
async for chunk in session.prompt_streaming("Write me a long story."):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

## Usage Examples

### System Prompts

```python
from wiki3_ai import LanguageModel, LanguageModelMessage, LanguageModelMessageRole

session = await LanguageModel.create({
    "initialPrompts": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful Python programming assistant."
        }
    ]
})

response = await session.prompt("How do I read a file in Python?")
print(response)
```

### Checking Availability

```python
from wiki3_ai import LanguageModel, Availability

# Check if the API is available
availability = await LanguageModel.availability()
print(f"Model availability: {availability}")

if availability == Availability.AVAILABLE:
    session = await LanguageModel.create()
    # Use the session...
```

### Configuring Temperature and Top-K

```python
# Get default parameters
params = await LanguageModel.params()
print(f"Default temperature: {params.default_temperature}")
print(f"Max temperature: {params.max_temperature}")

# Create session with custom parameters
session = await LanguageModel.create({
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "topK": 40
})
```

### Session Management

```python
# Create a session
session = await LanguageModel.create()

# Use the session
result1 = await session.prompt("Tell me about AI.")

# Clone for different conversation branches
session2 = await session.clone()
result2 = await session2.prompt("Now tell me about machine learning.")

# Destroy when done
await session.destroy()
```

### Measuring Token Usage

```python
session = await LanguageModel.create()

# Check current usage
print(f"Current usage: {session.input_usage}/{session.input_quota}")

# Measure potential usage before prompting
usage = await session.measure_input_usage("This is my prompt")
print(f"This prompt would use: {usage} tokens")

# Prompt if there's enough quota
if session.input_usage + usage < session.input_quota:
    result = await session.prompt("This is my prompt")
```

### Structured Output with JSON Schema

```python
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["rating"],
    "properties": {
        "rating": {
            "type": "number",
            "minimum": 0,
            "maximum": 5
        }
    }
}

result = await session.prompt(
    "Rate this: The food was excellent!",
    {"responseConstraint": schema}
)

import json
data = json.parse(result)
print(f"Rating: {data['rating']}")
```

## API Reference

### LanguageModel

Main class for interacting with the language model.

#### Class Methods

- `create(options=None)` - Create a new language model session
- `availability(options=None)` - Check model availability
- `params()` - Get model parameters

#### Instance Methods

- `prompt(input, options=None)` - Send a prompt and get response
- `prompt_streaming(input, options=None)` - Send a prompt and stream response
- `append(input, options=None)` - Append messages without getting response
- `measure_input_usage(input, options=None)` - Measure token usage
- `clone(options=None)` - Clone the session
- `destroy()` - Destroy the session

#### Properties

- `input_usage` - Current token usage
- `input_quota` - Maximum token quota
- `top_k` - Top-K sampling parameter
- `temperature` - Temperature sampling parameter

### Data Models

- `LanguageModelMessage` - A message in the conversation
- `LanguageModelMessageContent` - Content with type and value
- `LanguageModelMessageRole` - Message role (system/user/assistant)
- `LanguageModelMessageType` - Content type (text/image/audio)
- `LanguageModelCreateOptions` - Options for creating sessions
- `LanguageModelPromptOptions` - Options for prompting
- `LanguageModelParams` - Model parameters
- `Availability` - Availability status enum

## Architecture

This package uses:

- **AnyWidget** for Jupyter integration
- **Traitlets** for bidirectional Python ↔ JavaScript communication
- **Chrome Prompt API** for accessing built-in language models

The communication flow:
1. Python code calls methods on `LanguageModel`
2. Requests are serialized via traitlets to JavaScript
3. JavaScript calls Chrome's native Prompt API
4. Results are sent back via traitlets to Python
5. Python code receives async results

## Specifications

This implementation follows:
- [Chrome Prompt API Specification](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/prompt-api/)
- [WebIDL Interface Definitions](https://webmachinelearning.github.io/prompt-api/#idl-index)
- [Chrome Developer Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api)
