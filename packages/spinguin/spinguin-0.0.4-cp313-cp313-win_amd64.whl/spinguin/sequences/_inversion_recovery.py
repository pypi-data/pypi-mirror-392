) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Performs the inversion-recovery experiment. The experiment differs slightly
    from the actual inversion-recovery experiments performed on spectrometers.
    In this experiment, the inversion is performed only once, and the
    magnetization is detected at each step during the recovery (much faster).
    
    If the traditional inversion recovery is desired, use the function
    `inversion_recovery_fid()`.

    This experiment requires the following spin system properties to be defined:

    - spin_system.basis : must be built
    - spin_system.relaxation.theory
    - spin_system.relaxation.thermalization : must be True

    This experiment requires the following parameters to be defined:

    - parameters.magnetic_field : magnetic field of the spectrometer in Tesla
    - parameters.temperature : temperature of the sample in Kelvin

    Parameters
    ----------
    spin_system : SpinSystem
        Spin system to which the inversion-recovery experiment is performed.
    isotope : str
        Specifies the isotope, for example "1H", whose magnetization is inverted
        and detected. This function applies hard pulses.
    npoints : int
        Number of points in the simulation. Defines the total simulation time
        together with `time_step`.
    time_step : float
        Time step in the simulation (in seconds). Should be kept relatively
        short (e.g. 1 ms).

    Returns
    -------
    magnetizations : ndarray
        Two-dimensional array of size (nspins, npoints) containing the
        observed z-magnetizations for each spin at various times.
