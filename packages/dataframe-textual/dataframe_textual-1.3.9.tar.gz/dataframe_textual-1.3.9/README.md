# With Excel support (fastexcel, xlsxwriter)
pip install dataframe-textual[excel]
```

This installs an executable `dv`.

Then run:
```bash
dv <csv_file>
```

### Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
# Quick run using uvx without installation
uvx https://github.com/need47/dataframe-textual.git <csvfile>

# Clone or download the project
cd dataframe-textual
uv sync --extra excel  # with Excel support

# Run directly with uv
uv run dv <csv_file>
```

### Development installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/need47/dataframe-textual.git
cd dataframe-textual

# Install from local source
pip install -e .

# Or with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[excel,dev]"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage - Single File

```bash
# After pip install dataframe-textual
dv pokemon.csv

# Or if running from source
python main.py pokemon.csv

# Or with uv
uv run python main.py pokemon.csv

# Read from stdin (auto-detects format; defaults to TSV if not recognized)
cat data.tsv | dv
dv < data.tsv
```

### Multi-File Usage - Multiple Tabs

```bash
# Open multiple files in tabs
dv file1.csv file2.csv file3.csv

# Open multiple sheets in tabs in an Excel file
dv file.xlsx

# Mix files and stdin (read from stdin, then open file)
dv data1.tsv < data2.tsv
```

When multiple files are opened:
- Each file appears as a separate tab at the top
- Switch between tabs using `>` (next) or `<` (previous)
- Open additional files with `Ctrl+O`
- Close the current tab with `Ctrl+W`
- Each file maintains its own state (edits, sort order, selections, history, etc.)

## Features in Detail

### 1. Color-Coded Data Types

Columns are automatically styled based on their data type:
- **integer**: Cyan text, right-aligned
- **float**: Magenta text, right-aligned
- **string**: Green text, left-aligned
- **boolean**: Blue text, centered
- **temporal**: Yellow text, centered

### 2. Row Detail View

Press `Enter` on any row to open a modal showing all column values for that row.
Useful for examining wide datasets where columns don't fit on screen.

**In the Row Detail Modal**:
- Press `v` to **view** the main table to show only rows with the selected column value
- Press `"` to **filter** all rows containing the selected column value
- Press `q` or `Escape` to close the modal

### 3. Search & Filtering

The application provides multiple search modes for different use cases:

**Search Operations** - Direct value/expression matching in current column:
- **`|` - Column Expression Search**: Opens dialog to search current column with custom expression
- **`\` - Column Cursor Search**: Instantly search current column using the cursor value

**Find Operations** - Find by value/expression:
- **`/` - Column Find**: Find cursor value within current column
- **`?` - Column Expression Find**: Open dialog to search current column with expression
- **`f` - Global Find**: Find cursor value across all columns
- **`Ctrl+f` - Global Expression Find**: Open dialog to search all columns with expression

**Selection & Filtering**:
- **`'` - Toggle Row Selection**: Select/deselect current row (marks it for filtering)
- **`t` - Invert Selections**: Flip selection state of all rows at once
- **`T` - Clear Selections**: Remove all row selections and matches
- **`"` - Filter Selected**: Display only the selected rows and remove others
- **`v` - View by Value**: Filter/view rows by selected rows or cursor value (others hidden but preserved)
- **`V` - View by Expression**: Filter/view rows using custom Polars expression (others hidden but preserved)

**Advanced Matching Options**:

When searching or finding, you can use checkboxes in the dialog to enable:
- **Match Nocase**: Ignore case differences (e.g., "john", "John", "JOHN" all match)
- **Match Whole**: Match complete value, not partial substrings or words (e.g., "cat" won't match in "catfish")

These options work with plain text searches. Use Polars regex patterns in expressions for more control:
- **Case-insensitive matching in expressions**: Use `(?i)` prefix in regex (e.g., `(?i)john`)
- **Word boundaries in expressions**: Use `\b` in regex (e.g., `\bjohn\b` matches whole word)

**Quick Tips:**
- Search results highlight matching rows/cells in **red**
- Multiple searches **accumulate selections** - each new search adds to the selections
- Type-aware matching automatically converts values. Resort to string comparison if conversion fails
- Use `u` to undo any search or filter

### 3b. Find & Replace

The application provides powerful find and replace functionality for both single-column and global replacements.

**Replace Operations**:
- **`r` - Column Replace**: Replace values in the current column
- **`R` - Global Replace**: Replace values across all columns

**How It Works:**

When you press `r` or `R`, a dialog opens where you can enter:
1. **Find term**: The value or expression to search for
2. **Replace term**: What to replace matches with
3. **Matching options**:
   - **Match Nocase**: Ignore case differences when matching (unchecked by default)
   - **Match Whole**: Match complete words only, not partial words (unchecked by default)
4. **Replace option**:
   - Choose **"Replace All"** to replace all matches at once (with confirmation)
   - Otherwise, review and confirm each match individually

**Replace All** (`r` or `R` → Choose "Replace All"):
- Shows a confirmation dialog with the number of matches and replacements
- Replaces all matches with a single operation
- Full undo support with `u`
- Useful for bulk replacements when you're confident about the change

**Replace Interactive** (`r` or `R` → Choose "Replace Interactive"):
- Shows each match one at a time with a preview of the replacement
- For each match, press:
  - `Enter` or press the `Yes` button - **Replace this occurrence** and move to next
  - Press the `Skip` button - **Skip this occurrence** and move to next
  - `Escape` or press the `No` button - **Cancel** remaining replacements (but keep already-made replacements)
- Displays progress: `Occurrence X of Y` (Y = total matches, X = current)
- Shows the value that will be replaced and what it will become
- Useful for careful replacements where you want to review each change

**Search Term Types:**
- **Plain text**: Exact string match (e.g., "John" finds "John")
  - Use **Match Nocase** checkbox to match regardless of case (e.g., find "john", "John", "JOHN")
  - Use **Match Whole** checkbox to match complete words only (e.g., find "cat" but not in "catfish")
- **NULL**: Replace null/missing values (type `NULL`)
- **Expression**: Polars expressions for complex matching (e.g., `$_ > 50` for column replace)
- **Regex patterns**: Use Polars regex syntax for advanced matching
  - Case-insensitive: Use `(?i)` prefix (e.g., `(?i)john`)
  - Whole word: Use `\b` boundary markers (e.g., `\bjohn\b`)

**Examples:**

```
Find: "John"
Replace: "Jane"
→ All occurrences of "John" become "Jane"

Find: "john"
Replace: "jane"
Match Nocase: ✓ (checked)
→ "John", "JOHN", "john" all become "jane"

Find: "cat"
Replace: "dog"
Match Whole: ✓ (checked)
→ "cat" becomes "dog", but "catfish" is not matched

Find: "NULL"
Replace: "Unknown"
→ All null/missing values become "Unknown"

Find: "(?i)active"        # Case-insensitive
Replace: "inactive"
→ "Active", "ACTIVE", "active" all become "inactive"
```

**For Global Replace (`R`)**:
- Searches and replaces across all columns simultaneously
- Each column can have different matching behavior (string matching for text, numeric for numbers)
- Preview shows which columns contain matches before replacement
- Useful for standardizing values across multiple columns

**Features:**
- **Full history support**: Use `u` (undo) to revert any replacement
- **Visual feedback**: Matching cells are highlighted before you choose replacement mode
- **Safe operations**: Requires confirmation before replacing
- **Progress tracking**: Shows how many replacements have been made during interactive mode
- **Type-aware**: Respects column data types when matching and replacing
- **Flexible matching**: Support for case-insensitive and whole-word matching

**Tips:**
- Use interactive mode for one-time replacements to be absolutely sure
- Use "Replace All" for routine replacements (e.g., fixing typos, standardizing formats)
- Use **Match Nocase** for matching variations of names or titles
- Use **Match Whole** to avoid unintended partial replacements
- Use `u` immediately if you accidentally replace something wrong
- For complex replacements, use Polars expressions or regex patterns in the find term
- Test with a small dataset first before large replacements

### 4. [Polars Expressions](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/expressions/index.html)

Complex values or filters can be specified via Polars expressions, with the following adaptions for convenience:

**Column References:**
- `$_` - Current column (based on cursor position)
- `$1`, `$2`, etc. - Column by 1-based index
- `$age`, `$salary` - Column by name (use actual column names)

**Row References:**
- `$#` - Current row index (1-based)

**Basic Comparisons:**
- `$_ > 50` - Current column greater than 50
- `$salary >= 100000` - Salary at least 100,000
- `$age < 30` - Age less than 30
- `$status == 'active'` - Status exactly matches 'active'
- `$name != 'Unknown'` - Name is not 'Unknown'

**Logical Operators:**
- `&` - AND
- `|` - OR
- `~` - NOT

**Practical Examples:**
- `($age < 30) & ($status == 'active')` - Age less than 30 AND status is active
- `($name == 'Alice') | ($name == 'Bob')` - Name is Alice or Bob
- `$salary / 1000 >= 50` - Salary divided by 1,000 is at least 50
- `($department == 'Sales') & ($bonus > 5000)` - Sales department with bonus over 5,000
- `($score >= 80) & ($score <= 90)` - Score between 80 and 90
- `~($status == 'inactive')` - Status is not inactive
- `$revenue > $expenses` - Revenue exceeds expenses

**String Matching:**
- `$name.str.contains("John")` - Name contains "John" (case-sensitive)
- `$name.str.contains("(?i)john")` - Name contains "john" (case-insensitive)
- `$email.str.ends_with("@company.com")` - Email ends with domain
- `$code.str.starts_with("ABC")` - Code starts with "ABC"
- `$age.cast(pl.String).str.starts_with("7")` - Age (cast to string first) starts with "7"

**Number Operations:**
- `$age * 2 > 100` - Double age greater than 100
- `($salary + $bonus) > 150000` - Total compensation over 150,000
- `$percentage >= 50` - Percentage at least 50%

**Null Handling:**
- `$column.is_null()` - Find null/missing values
- `$column.is_not_null()` - Find non-null values
- `NULL` - a value to represent null for convenience

**Tips:**
- Use column names that match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use parentheses to clarify complex expressions: `($a & $b) | ($c & $d)`

### 5. Sorting

- Press `[` to sort current column ascending
- Press `]` to sort current column descending
- Multi-column sorting supported (press multiple times on different columns)
- Press same key twice to remove the column from sorting

### 6. Frequency Distribution

- **Scans** all cells in the current column for URLs starting with `http://` or `https://`
- **Applies** link styling to make them clickable and dataframe remains unchanged

### 19. SQL Interface

The SQL interface provides two modes for querying your dataframe:

#### Simple SQL Interface (`l`)
Select specific columns and apply WHERE conditions without writing full SQL:
- Choose which columns to include in results
- Specify WHERE clause for filtering
- Ideal for quick filtering and column selection

#### Advanced SQL Interface (`L`)
Execute complete SQL queries for advanced data manipulation:

- Support for JOINs, GROUP BY, aggregations, and more
- Access to all SQL capabilities for complex transformations
- Always use `self` as the table name

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Filter and select specific rows and/or columns
SELECT name, age FROM self WHERE age > 30

-- Aggregate with GROUP BY
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM self
GROUP BY department

-- Complex filtering with multiple conditions
SELECT *
FROM self
WHERE (age > 25 AND salary > 50000) OR department = 'Management'
```
