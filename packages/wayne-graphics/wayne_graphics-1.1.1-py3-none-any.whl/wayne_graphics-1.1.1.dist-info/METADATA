 Installation

`bash
pip install wayne-graphics
`

---

 Quick Start

`python
from wayne_graphics.core import WayneGraphics
from wayne_graphics.shapes import drawRect, drawCircle, drawText
from wayne_graphics.events import onMousePress, onKeyPress

Create a window
app = WayneGraphics(width=600, height=400, title="Wayne Demo")

Draw shapes
drawRect(app.canvas, 50, 50, 100, 60, color="blue")
drawCircle(app.canvas, 300, 200, 40, color="red")
drawText(app.canvas, 150, 300, "Hello Wayne!", font=("Courier", 16), color="green")

Handle mouse click
def handle_click(x, y):
    print(f"Mouse clicked at ({x}, {y})")

onMousePress(app.canvas, handle_click)

Handle key press
def handle_key(char):
    print(f"Key pressed: {char}")

onKeyPress(app.root, handle_key)

Run the app
app.run()
`
