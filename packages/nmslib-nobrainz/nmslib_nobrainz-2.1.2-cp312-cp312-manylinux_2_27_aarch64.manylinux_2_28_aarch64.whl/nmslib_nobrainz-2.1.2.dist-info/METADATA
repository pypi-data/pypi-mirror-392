Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) is an efficient cross-platform
 similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. 
 The goal of the project is to create an effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching 
 in generic and non-metric spaces. Even though the library contains a variety of metric-space 
 access methods, our main focus is on generic and approximate search methods, in particular, 
 on methods for non-metric spaces. NMSLIB is possibly the first library with a principled 
 support for non-metric space searching.
