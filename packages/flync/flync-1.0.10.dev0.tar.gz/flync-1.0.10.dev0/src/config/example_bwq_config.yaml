# Example configuration file for BigWigQuery
# This file demonstrates how to configure BigWig/BigBed files and statistics

# Each item in the list represents a BigWig/BigBed file to query
- path: /path/to/your/file1.bigWig  # Path to BigWig file (local or URL)
  upstream: 1000                    # Optional: bases to extend upstream
  downstream: 1000                  # Optional: bases to extend downstream
  stats:                            # List of statistics to calculate
    - stat: mean                    # Statistic type
      name: h3k27ac_mean            # Column name in output
    - stat: max
      name: h3k27ac_max
    - stat: coverage
      name: h3k27ac_coverage

# Another file with different statistics
- path: https://example.com/file2.bigBed  # Remote BigBed file
  stats:
    - stat: coverage
      name: peaks_coverage
    - stat: extract_names           # Extract names from BigBed entries
      name: peak_names
      name_field_index: 3           # Field index for name (0-based)

# You can add as many files as needed
- path: /path/to/your/file3.bigWig
  upstream: 500
  downstream: 500
  stats:
    - stat: mean
      name: expression_mean
    - stat: min
