# FLYNC Sample List - Plain Text Format
#
# This is the simplest way to specify samples for processing.
# Just list one sample ID per line.
#
# Sample IDs must match your FASTQ file prefixes:
#   - For paired-end: sample1_1.fastq.gz, sample1_2.fastq.gz
#   - For single-end: sample1.fastq.gz
#
# Lines starting with # are ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored.
