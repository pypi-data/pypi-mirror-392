Quick Start:

    >>> chart = ChartBuilder.from_notable("Albert Einstein").build()
    >>> draw_chart(chart, "einstein.svg")

For more control:
    >>> from starlight import ChartBuilder, Native, ReportBuilder
    >>> from starlight.engines import PlacidusHouses, ModernAspectEngine
    >>> native = Native(datetime_input=..., location_input=...)
    >>> chart = ChartBuilder.from_native(native).build()
