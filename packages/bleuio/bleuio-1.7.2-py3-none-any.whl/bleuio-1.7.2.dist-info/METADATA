## Python library v1.7.2 for BleuIO — 2025-11-19

### Supports BleuIO v.2.7.9.29 and BleuIO Pro 1.0.4.14

> NOTE: Does not support fw version 2.2.0 or earlier of BleuIO Standard (SSD005).

### Changes 

#### 1.7.2
- Command functions
    * Added function for command ATAR (enable/disable auto reconnect) introduced in BleuIO Standard v. 2.7.9.29:
        - atar() 
    * Uppdated functions to poll status if no parameters are given (added in BleuIO Standard v. 2.7.9.29). The following comands are affected:
        * ata()
        * atasps()
        * atassm()
        * atassn()
        * atds()
        * ate()
        * atew()
        * atsiv()
        * atsra()
        * atsat()
        * at_frssi()
        * at_show_rssi()
- Added
    * Library now uses Python's logging module instead of print statements (for debug, warnings, info etc.).
    * New constructor parameters:
        * w_timeout — write timeout for serial port.
        * exclusive_mode — optional exclusive access flag passed to pyserial.
        * rx_delay — enables short non-blocking sleep in RX thread when no bytes are waiting (helps CPU usage on some platforms / busy loops).
- RX thread behavior:
   * Now supports configurable rx_delay to avoid blocking reads and reduce CPU usage when no data is available.
- Thread / exit handling:
    * Safer exit_handler and SIGINT handler attempt (safe if not main thread).

#### 1.7.0
- Improved responsiveness and improved throughput
- Added functions for commands introduced up to BleuIO fw version 2.7.9.11 and BleuIO Pro fw version 1.0.4.14:
  - at_set_autoexec_pwd / at_enter_autoexec_pwd / at_clr_autoexec_pwd
- Added function for missing command ATEW:
  - atew
- Disables terminal echo by default
- Better handling of event and scan result parsing.


#### 1.6.1

- Renamed misleading function parameter names. The parameter name 'uuid' has been changed to 'handle' in the following functions: *at_gattcread()*, *at_gattcwrite()*, *at_gattcwritewr()*, *at_gattcwritewrb()*, *at_get_service_details()*. The affected descriptions have also been updated, as well as the documentation, to reflect this.
- Fixed typo. Changed name of function *at_divicename()* to *at_devicename()*.

#### 1.6.0

- Added functions for commands introduced up to BleuIO fw version 2.7.6 and BleuIO Pro fw 1.0.1.
- Improved the auto-detect feature, when not specifying a COM port. It will now detect if a detected BleuIO COM port is in use and try to use the next unused BleuIO COM port it finds until no more BleuIO COM ports are detected.

#### 1.5.0

- Added functions for commands introduced up to BleuIO fw version 2.7.4.
- Added support for BleuIO Pro
- Added functions for commands exclusive to BleuIO Pro fw version 1.0.0.

#### 1.4.0

- Added functions for commands introduced in firmware 2.5.0 and up to BleuIO fw version 2.7.1.

#### 1.3.1

- Added support for SUOTA commands introduced in BleuIO fw version 2.4.0
- Fixed a bug when running on MacOS where the serial responses sometimes are returned in two parts instead of just one. The library expected one but can now handle two or more.

#### 1.3.0

- Added support for commands introduced in BleuIO fw version 2.2.2 and 2.3.0
- Fixed a bug where the BLE status variables for connection weren't updated properly.
- Increased the time trying to connect to the selected Dongle COM port before aborting.

#### 1.2.0

- Supports and makes use of the new Verbose mode introduced in 2.2.1

### Instructions

- Install the library by running:

```shell
pip install bleuio
```

- In the python file import:

```python
 from bleuio_lib.bleuio_funcs import BleuIO
```

- Here is an example on how to get started:

```python
# (C) 2025 Smart Sensor Devices AB

import time
from datetime import datetime
from bleuio_lib.bleuio_funcs import BleuIO
# For enabling logging
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Description
# This is an example script that showcase how to get started with the BleuIO library for Python.
# It will show how to setup callback functions for scan results and events.
# How to send a command and what responses you get and how you can handle them.
# How to start and stop a scan.
# How to start and stop advertising.
# How to check the BLE Status of the dongle.


# Creating a callback function for scan results. For this example we just prints out the result.
# Here you can add your code to parse the data.
def my_scan_callback(scan_input):
    print("\n\nmy_evt_callback: " + str(scan_input))


# Creating a callback function for events. For this example we add a timestamp and just prints out the event.
# Here you can add your code to parse the data.
def my_evt_callback(evt_input):
    cbTime = datetime.now()
    currentTime = cbTime.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    print("\n\n[" + str(currentTime) + "] my_evt_callback: " + str(evt_input))


# Start

# Initiates the dongle. If port param is left as 'auto' it will auto-detect if BleuIO dongle is connected.
# port (str): Serial port name or "auto" for automatic detection
# baud (int): Baud rate for serial communication (default: 115200)
# timeout (float): Serial read timeout in seconds (default: 0.01)
# w_timeout (float): Serial write timeout in seconds (default: 0.01)
# exclusive_mode (bool): Set exclusive access mode (POSIX only) (default: None)
# rx_delay (float): If > 0 enables delay in seconds in rx thread if no bytes are waiting (default: 0)
# debug (bool): Enable debug logging (default: False)

# Auto-Detect dongle (no debug)
my_dongle = BleuIO()

# Auto-Detect dongle (showing debug info)
# my_dongle = BleuIO(debug=True)

# Specific COM port (Win) 'COMX'
# my_dongle = BleuIO(port='COM7')

# Specific COM port (Linux) 'dev/tty.xxxxx...'

# Here we send a simple AT Command. All commands will return a BleuIORESP obj.

# If we only want to see if the was successful we can do like this:
print("Err: " + str(ati_exemple.Ack["err"]))
# or
print("errMsg: " + str(ati_exemple.Ack["errMsg"]))

# Here is an example on how to scan.
# First we need to put the dongle in Central or Dual Gap Role

# Now we start scanning

# We can either send in a timeout as a parameter for the at_gapscan() command or stop the scan when we're done.
# Here we just set a three second sleep then stop scan.
# Notice that all the scan data will be printed by our my_scan_callback() function.
