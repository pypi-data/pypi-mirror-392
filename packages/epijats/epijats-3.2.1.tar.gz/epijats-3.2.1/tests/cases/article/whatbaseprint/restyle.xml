      <abstract>
        <p>A baseprint is a digitally encoded document
        created to disseminate research
        across independent websites
        in both PDF and HTML formats.
        Compared to PDF files, baseprints offer advantages for research communication
        by combining features of preprints and blog posts.
        A preliminary type of baseprint is based on JATS4R (JATS XML) and Software Heritage IDs.
        However, as of 2022,
        the technology for working with baseprints is new and still under development,
        and
        the tools for working with baseprints are not yet user-friendly.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Multiple independent websites
      can automatically generate
      both a PDF file and an HTML page
      from a baseprint digitally encoded in JATS XML.
      JATS XML is often used to encode journal articles
      published in both PDF and HTML formats,
      many of which appear on both the publisher&#8217;s website and PubMed Central,
      a US government agency website for scientific literature.</p>
      <p>Baseprints provide features of preprints and blog posts
      through the generation of PDF files and HTML pages.
      The following table summarizes
      the advantages of baseprints over PDF preprints and blog posts:</p>
