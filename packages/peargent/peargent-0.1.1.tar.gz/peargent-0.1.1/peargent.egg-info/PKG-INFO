- **Cost Tracking** - Monitor token usage and costs across all LLM providers

## Installation

```bash
pip install peargent
```

## Quick Start

```python
from peargent import create_agent
from peargent.models import groq

agent = create_agent(
    name="assistant",
    persona="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
    model=groq("llama-3.3-70b-versatile")
)

result = agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(result)
```
