The Neurobagel CLI is a Python command-line tool to automatically parse and describe subject phenotypic and imaging attributes in an annotated dataset for integration into the Neurobagel graph.

**For information on how to use the CLI, please refer to the [official Neurobagel documentation](https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/cli/).**

## Installation
The Neurobagel CLI is available as a Python package that can be installed from PyPI using:

```bash
pip install bagel
```

(If you prefer to run the CLI using Docker or Singularity containers instead, please refer to the [Neurobagel documentation](https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/cli/).)

## Development environment

### Setting up a local development environment
To work on the CLI, we suggest that you create a development environment 
that is as close as possible to the environment we run in production.

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neurobagel/bagel-cli.git
    cd bagel-cli
    ```

2. Install the CLI and all development dependencies in editable mode:

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

3. Install the `bids-examples` and `neurobagel_examples` submodules needed to run the test suite:
    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

Confirm that everything works well by running the tests: 
`pytest .`

### Setting up code formatting and linting (recommended)

[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is configured in the development environment for this repository, and can be set up to automatically run a number of code linters and formatters on any commit you make according to the consistent code style set for this project.

Run the following from the repository root to install the configured pre-commit "hooks" for your local clone of the repo:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit will now run automatically whenever you run `git commit`.

### Updating dependencies
If new runtime or development dependencies are needed, add them to `pyproject.toml` using minimal version constraints.

## Regenerating the Neurobagel vocabulary file
Terms in the Neurobagel namespace (`nb` prefix) and their class relationships are serialized to a file 
called [nb_vocab.ttl](https://github.com/neurobagel/recipes/blob/main/vocab/nb_vocab.ttl), which is automatically
uploaded to new Neurobagel graph deployments.
This vocabulary is used by Neurobagel APIs to fetch available attributes and attribute instances from a graph store.

When the Neurobagel graph data model is updated (e.g., if new classes or subclasses are created), 
this file should be regenerated by running:
```bash
python helper_scripts/generate_nb_vocab_file.py
```
This will create a file called `nb_vocab.ttl` in the current working directory.
