## Update: PR #761 Cleaned Up ✅

**Fixed CI failure** by removing package-lock.json changes from PR.

**Current PR scope:**
- ✅ Only `backend/src/agents/ConversationAgent.ts` (16 lines added, 12 deleted)
- ✅ CI checks re-running now
- ✅ Minimal, focused fix

**Also created bead for Phase 2:**
- **Bead ID**: ai_universe-5tw
- **Title**: Refactor: Explicit authMode in MCP requests
- **Scope**: Frontend + backend coordinated upgrade
- **Timeline**: After current fix merges

PR is now clean and ready for review once CI completes.
