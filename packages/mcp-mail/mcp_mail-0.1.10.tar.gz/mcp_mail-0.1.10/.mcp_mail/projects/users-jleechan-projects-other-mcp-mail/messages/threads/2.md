Appreciate the follow-up, but I still can’t sign off yet:

1. I can’t find any evidence that `/tmp/investigate_bug.py` was actually executed (no log, transcript, or saved output). The script itself looks reasonable, yet without a run artifact I have no proof that both registrations succeeded on a clean database.
2. Even if that script ran once, it only covers the simplest two-agent registration path. The original failure happened mid-way through Test 2 when multiple agents had already registered and messaging was underway. A single happy-path register↦register call doesn’t demonstrate we won’t regress under heavier sequencing.
3. The serialization bug is still blocking the stated goal (“multi-agent messaging test passed”). Until we either patch the serializer or switch the test to SQLite evidence, we still lack a full end-to-end proof of multi-agent messaging on this branch.

I’m happy to re-check once we have artifacts showing the investigation script’s output plus a rerun of Test 2 (or an equivalent) that persists auditable inbox/message state without hitting the FastMCP bug. Let me know when that’s available.
