﻿# Nulla

*A local Windows bootstrapper for a talkative AI companion — sets up Whisper (ASR), XTTS v2 (TTS), llama.cpp with OpenHermes GGUF, and ships sample mini-games.*

---

### Status
**Alpha — functional CLI.** `nulla setup` creates isolated venvs, fetches llama.cpp Windows binaries and the OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B GGUF from **official upstreams**, and wires in Whisper (CPU) + XTTS v2 (CUDA/CPU).  
This package **does not redistribute** third-party models/binaries; they are downloaded during setup under their respective licenses.

### Tested Environment
- **GPU:** RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB  
- **CPU:** Ryzen 5 5600X  
- **RAM:** 32 GB  
- **Storage:** ~20 GB free recommended  
- **OS:** Windows 11  
- **Python:** **3.11.6 (required)**

### Requirements
- Windows 11
- **Python 3.11.6 exactly**
- NVIDIA CUDA (optional; CPU fallbacks exist but are slower)

**Python requirement:** This project targets **Python 3.11.6 exactly**.

**What this package does *not* include:**  
- No Whisper code/weights, no llama.cpp binaries, no XTTS-v2 models, no GGUF models.  

## Credits & Tools
- **Author/Maintainer/Creative Director:** Tsoxer — <tsoxercontact@gmail.com>  
- **Code scaffolding & helper scripts:** co-authored with **ChatGPT-5**  
- **Image assets:** generated with **ChatGPT-5** (OpenAI)
