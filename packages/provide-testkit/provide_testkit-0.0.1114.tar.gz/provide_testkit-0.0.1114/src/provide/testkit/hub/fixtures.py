"""Hub Testing Fixtures for Foundation.

Provides pytest fixtures for testing hub and component functionality,
including container directories and component registration scenarios.

Dependency Injection Testing
-----------------------------

These fixtures support Foundation's dependency injection architecture,
enabling isolated testing without global state resets.

Key fixtures:
- `isolated_container`: Creates a fresh Container for each test
- `isolated_hub`: Creates a Hub with an isolated Container
- `default_container_directory`: Provides temp directory for containers

Example usage:
    >>> def test_with_isolated_hub(isolated_hub):
    ...     # Each test gets its own Hub with clean state
    ...     # No need to call reset_foundation_setup_for_testing()
    ...     client = UniversalClient(hub=isolated_hub)
    ...     # Test proceeds with isolated dependencies"""

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def default_container_directory() -> Any:
    """
    Provides a default directory for container operations in tests.

    This fixture is used by tests that need a temporary directory
    for container-related operations.
    """

        yield tmp_dir


@pytest.fixture
def isolated_container() -> Any:
    """
    Create an isolated Container for dependency injection testing.

    This fixture provides a fresh Container instance for each test,
    eliminating the need for global state resets between tests.

    Returns:
        Container: A new Container instance with no pre-registered dependencies.

    Example:
        >>> def test_my_component(isolated_container):
        ...     # Register test-specific dependencies
        ...     isolated_container.register("my_service", MyService())
        ...     # Test with isolated state
        ...     service = isolated_container.resolve("my_service")
        ...     assert service is not None

    Note:
        Tests using this fixture do not need to call
        reset_foundation_setup_for_testing() as each test
        gets a fresh container automatically.
    """
    from provide.foundation.hub import Container

    return Container()


@pytest.fixture
def isolated_hub() -> Any:
    """
    Create an isolated Hub with fresh registries for testing.

    This fixture provides a Hub instance with isolated registries,
    enabling dependency injection testing without global state side effects.

    Returns:
        Hub: A Hub instance with isolated registries.

    Example:
        >>> def test_with_di(isolated_hub):
        ...     # Hub has fresh, isolated state
        ...     client = UniversalClient(hub=isolated_hub)
        ...     # Test proceeds without affecting global Hub
        ...     response = await client.get("https://api.example.com")
        ...     assert response.status == 200

    Note:
        This fixture is ideal for unit tests that need Hub functionality
        but want complete isolation from other tests. No reset functions
        are needed when using this fixture.
