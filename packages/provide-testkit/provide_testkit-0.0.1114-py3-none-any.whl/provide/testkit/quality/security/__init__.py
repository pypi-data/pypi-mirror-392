"""Security analysis integration for provide-testkit.

Provides comprehensive security scanning using multiple security tools:
- Bandit: Python SAST (static application security testing)
- pip-audit: Dependency vulnerability scanning (PyPI advisories)
- Safety: Dependency vulnerability scanning (PyUp database)
- GitLeaks: Secret detection (fast, pattern-based)
- TruffleHog: Deep secret detection (entropy analysis, verification)
- Semgrep: Pattern-based SAST with custom rules

Features:
- Multiple vulnerability scanners for comprehensive coverage
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret/credential detection
- Security issue reporting and classification
- Integration with quality gates
- Artifact management for CI/CD

Note: Checkov (IaC security scanner) was removed due to dependency conflicts with pynguin.
If you need IaC security scanning, install checkov separately and use it via subprocess.

Usage:
    # Basic security scanning (Bandit)
    def test_with_security(security_scanner):
        result = security_scanner.scan(path)
        assert result.passed

    # Dependency vulnerability scanning
    from provide.testkit.quality.security import PipAuditScanner
    scanner = PipAuditScanner()
    result = scanner.analyze(path)

    # Secret detection
    from provide.testkit.quality.security import GitLeaksScanner
    scanner = GitLeaksScanner()
    result = scanner.analyze(path)
