Go to Settings > Technical > Models.

Choose the model you wish to edit, and open its form view. Go to the "Create/Edit Options" tab,
and add the fields you want to manage in 2 different sections:

* the first list view allows you to handle fields for the selected model
* the second list view allows you to handle fields where the selected model is the comodel

For both sections:

* button "Fill" will add every missing field to the options
* button "Empty" will remove every option
