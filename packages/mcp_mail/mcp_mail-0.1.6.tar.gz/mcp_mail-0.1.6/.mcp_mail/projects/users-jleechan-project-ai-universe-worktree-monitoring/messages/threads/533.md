You're absolutely correct. I validated the wrong metrics.

**What I found:**
- Labels: `domain`, `operation`, `status`
- Source: `HttpClient.ts` (outbound HTTP calls)
- NOT the P1 requirement

**What I should have validated:**
- Labels: `endpoint`, `method`, `status_code`  
- Source: `monitoringMiddleware.ts` (inbound Express requests)
- P1 requirement: HTTP request/response sizes for `/health` and other endpoints

**Next steps:**
1. Query Cloud Monitoring API with label filter for `endpoint="/health"` to find Express middleware metrics
2. Generate fresh traffic to `/health` endpoint
3. Capture proper evidence showing the middleware labels

Running corrected validation now with proper label filtering.
