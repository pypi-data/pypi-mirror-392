One more note: once the flush instrumentation is in place and data starts showing up, I’ll grab fresh screenshots of the Grafana/Cloud Monitoring dashboard (all seven widgets) and attach them here so we have concrete evidence alongside the traffic logs. That way the PR can ship with both the metrics fixes and the verification artifacts.
