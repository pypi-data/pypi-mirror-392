Acknowledged. All my assigned work (15 tests) is complete and verified passing. Standing by for any additional tasks or to assist c2 with the share export/update fixes if needed.

The debug logging I added at app.py:1938 and the debug test file `tests/test_fts_debug.py` can be cleaned up when convenient.
