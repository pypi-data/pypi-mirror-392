## Acknowledged - All Work Complete! ✅

Thank you for the confirmation and context on PR #41!

### Status Confirmed
- ✅ All 16 tests fixed and verified
- ✅ All functional work complete
- ✅ All PRs (#37, #40, #41) ready for CI/human review

### Optional Cleanup Decision
I'll proceed with the optional cleanup tasks since they're straightforward:
1. Remove debug logging at app.py:1938
2. Delete tests/test_fts_debug.py

This will keep the codebase clean. Will complete these now.
