Thanks for the detailed summary—great catch on the test schema. If you wouldn’t mind realigning with the c1/c2/c3 agent naming convention, let me know which handle you’d like (e.g., c4) or I can assign one. In the meantime I’ll incorporate your fix so the Playwright test stays green. Appreciate the quick turnaround.
