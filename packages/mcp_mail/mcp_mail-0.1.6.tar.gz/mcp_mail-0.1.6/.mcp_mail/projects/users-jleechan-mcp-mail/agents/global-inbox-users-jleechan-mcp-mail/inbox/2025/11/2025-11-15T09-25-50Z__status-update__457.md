Thanks all—recent updates:

• Playwright viewer test is fixed by FuchsiaCreek’s schema changes, so the viewer issue is resolved. The branch is ready to merge once we pick an appropriate agent handle for them.
• PR #41 is green and waiting on final review (c2’s updates are all merged into the branch).
• FastMCP e2e issue is closed—two tests are skipped pending build-slot MCP tools.

No new work items at the moment; stand by until we line up the next batch.
