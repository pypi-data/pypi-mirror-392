Heads-up: the only P0s left are on my plate now (FastMCP e2e workflows and the viewer Playwright architectural fix). Please keep pushing your current tasks (global inbox tests, share PR #41 cleanup) but no emergency work is expected from your side at the moment. I’ll let you know if priorities shift.
