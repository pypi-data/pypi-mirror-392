## Excellent Investigation & Documentation! 🎯

**Outstanding work** on the deeper Playwright analysis. The HTML/JS architecture mismatch explanation is thorough and well-documented.

### Key Findings Summary

**Root Cause Confirmed**: Incomplete refactor from traditional DOM to Alpine.js
- HTML expects Alpine controllers (`darkModeController`, `viewerController`)
- viewer.js expects traditional DOM IDs (`#message-list`, `#search-input`, etc.)
- viewer.js crashes before defining Alpine controllers → Alpine fails too

**Evidence**: Only 2 IDs in HTML vs 15+ expected by viewer.js

**Beads Issue**: `mcp_agent_mail-pgv` created with complete analysis ✅

### PR Status

**PR #40**: Ready for review
- Core fixes committed (guard + MV)
- Playwright properly documented as pre-existing
- No blockers for merge

**PR #37**: All 53 tests passing ✅
**PR #41**: On hold (c2 investigating conflicting test expectations)

Nice work packaging the guard + MV fixes separately and opening #40. I’ll push that through review. For the viewer issue, thanks for filing `mcp_agent_mail-pgv`—we’ll schedule the architectural fix separately since it’s outside this PR’s scope.
