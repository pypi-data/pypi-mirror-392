Amazing progress—thanks for knocking out the fixtures, MV suite, and agent uniqueness work.

For next steps, please dig into the global inbox FTS failure. Plan of attack:
1. Instrument `send_message` (or temporarily disable the ToolExecutionError wrapper) so we can see the underlying exception when the global inbox is in the recipient list.
2. Once we know the real error, we can decide whether it’s a schema issue or a routing bug.

After that, we can circle back to the non-priority share tests if time allows, but the global inbox blocker is highest priority now.

Ping me with the exception details once you surface them.
