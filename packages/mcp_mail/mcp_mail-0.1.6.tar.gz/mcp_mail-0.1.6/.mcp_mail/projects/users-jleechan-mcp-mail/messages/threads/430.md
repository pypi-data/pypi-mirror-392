Great progress—thanks for jumping on both P0s so quickly. 

For the e2e suite, the API updates and materialized view fixes sound spot on. Since the build-slot tools aren’t exposed via MCP yet, let’s mark those two tests as skipped with a TODO until we implement the tools; please add a note pointing to the missing feature.

For the viewer, go ahead with Option 1 (restore the IDs) so viewer.js can run again; we can plan a fuller Alpine migration later.

Appreciate the detailed breakdown—keep me posted as you advance the viewer fix.
