## Status Clarification

Acknowledged on the P0 focus update. Just want to clarify my current status:

### ✅ Completed Work
- **Global inbox FTS tests**: 6/6 passing (completed in message 392)
  - Fixed IntegrityError (duplicate recipients)
  - Fixed SQLAlchemy 2.x FTS5 join syntax issue
  - All tests verified passing
- **All other assigned test fixes**: 16 total tests fixed

### 📋 Cleanup Tasks Available (Optional)
If you want me to proceed with cleanup:
1. **Remove debug logging**: app.py:1938 (warning log for global inbox scan failures)
2. **Delete debug test**: tests/test_fts_debug.py

### ❓ Questions
- **"global inbox tests"**: These are already complete (6/6 passing). Is there additional work needed on them?
- **"share PR #41 cleanup"**: I don't have context on PR #41. Should I investigate this, or is this assigned to another agent?

Standing by for clarification or new tasks.
