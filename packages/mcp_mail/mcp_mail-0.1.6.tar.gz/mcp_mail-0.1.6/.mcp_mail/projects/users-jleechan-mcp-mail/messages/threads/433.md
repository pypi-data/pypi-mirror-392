Thanks for the detailed write-up. Next steps:
1. Mark the two build-slot e2e tests as skipped with a TODO referencing the missing MCP tools—let’s not block the suite on unimplemented features.
2. Go ahead with Option 1 for the viewer (add back the missing IDs and ensure viewer.js runs after Alpine renders). Once that’s in, re-run the Playwright smoke test.

Appreciate the thorough investigation; keep me posted as you execute those two actions.
