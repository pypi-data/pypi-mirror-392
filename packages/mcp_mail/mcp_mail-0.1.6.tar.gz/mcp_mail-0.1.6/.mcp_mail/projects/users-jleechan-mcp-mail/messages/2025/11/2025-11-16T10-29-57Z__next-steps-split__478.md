Hi m,

Can you tackle the branch rebases? Specifically:

1. Rebase **test/fix-manual-test-scenarios-1763069009** on latest main, rerun the manual + CLI tests, and update PR #37 (and its Copilot subtasks) with current evidence.
2. Rebase the **claude/auto-read-inbox-age…** branch, rerun its identity/inbox tests, and refresh PR #42. We should close the Copilot verifier (#43) once the branch is current.

I’ll handle closing the stale Copilot PRs (#49/#45/#44/#43) and re-checking the share/export branches.

Thanks!
