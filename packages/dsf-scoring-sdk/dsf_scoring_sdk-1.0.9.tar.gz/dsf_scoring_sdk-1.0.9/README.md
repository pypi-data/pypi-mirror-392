# DSF Adaptive Scoring SDK

An **enterprise-grade adaptive credit scoring system** that replaces static risk models and hard-coded rules with a configurable, intelligent decision engine.

---

## 🚀 Why DSF Scoring?

Traditional risk models are static — they're trained once and quickly become outdated, failing to adapt to new market conditions or applicant behaviors.  
The DSF Scoring SDK transforms your credit logic into a **configurable, self-adjusting scoring engine** that evolves based on real-world data and context.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

Instead of rigid, static rules (e.g., "DTI must be < 0.4"), DSF lets you define risk policies as weighted **features**.  
The system then evaluates how well each applicant matches an *ideal profile*, producing a dynamic **credit score**.

This shifts your scoring logic from hard-coded rules to a **living configuration** that's easy to maintain and evolve.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install dsf-scoring-sdk
```

⚠️ **Requires SDK ≥ 1.0.8**

## 🧩 Quick Start

### Community Edition (Free)

Perfect for testing, MVPs, or low-volume use.

```python
from dsf_scoring_sdk import CreditScoreClient, LicenseError

# 1. Configure your features
config = {
    "monthly_income": {"default": 3000, "weight": 1.8, "criticality": 2.0},
    "debt_to_income": {"default": 0.3, "weight": 2.5, "criticality": 3.0}
}

# 2. Define the applicant
applicant = {"monthly_income": 2800, "debt_to_income": 0.42}

# 3. Evaluate
try:
    with CreditScoreClient(api_key="dsf_api_prod_XXXXX", tier="community") as client:
        result = client.evaluate(applicant, config)
        print(f"Decision: {result['decision']}")
        print(f"Score: {result['score']:.4f}")
        print(f"Threshold: {result['threshold']}")
except LicenseError as e:
    print(f"License Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Professional Edition (Batch Processing + Metrics + Traces)

```python
from dsf_scoring_sdk import CreditScoreClient

client = CreditScoreClient(
    api_key="dsf_api_prod_XXXXX",
    tier="professional",
    license_key="PRO-2026-12-31-XXXX-XXXX"
)

applicants = [
    {"monthly_income": 5000, "debt_to_income": 0.25},
    {"monthly_income": 2100, "debt_to_income": 0.55},
    {"monthly_income": 3100, "debt_to_income": 0.31}
]

results = client.evaluate_batch(applicants, config, enable_trace=True)

print(f"Adaptive Threshold: {results['threshold']:.4f}")
print(f"Batch Decisions: {results['decisions']}")
print(f"Batch Scores: {results['scores']}")
print(f"Metrics: {results['metrics']}")
print(f"Traces: {results['explanation_traces']}")

client.close()
```

### Enterprise Edition (Adaptive Weighting + Advanced Metrics)

```python
from dsf_scoring_sdk import CreditScoreClient

client = CreditScoreClient(
    api_key="dsf_api_prod_XXXXX",
    tier="enterprise",
    license_key="ENT-2026-12-31-XXXX-XXXX"
)

result = client.evaluate(applicant, config)
metrics = result.get('metrics', {})

print(f"Evaluations: {metrics['evaluations']}")
print(f"Avg Score: {metrics['avg_score']}")
print(f"Threshold: {metrics['threshold']}")
print(f"Tier: {metrics['tier']}")
print(f"Storage: {metrics['storage']}")
```

## 🔍 Explainability Traces

**Available for Professional and Enterprise tiers.**

Enable explainability to understand which features drove each decision:

```python
results = client.evaluate_batch(applicants, config, enable_trace=True)
traces = results["explanation_traces"]
```

**Trace example:**

```python
"0": [
  {"feature": "person_income", "contribution_pct": 26.22, "similarity": 0.6892},
  {"feature": "loan_percent_income", "contribution_pct": 28.30, "similarity": 0.6376},
  {"feature": "previous_loan_defaults_on_file", "contribution_pct": 23.20, "similarity": 1.0000}
]
```

---

## 📊 Model Metrics Returned (Pro & Enterprise)

```python
{
  "evaluations": 100,
  "avg_score": 0.6814,
  "threshold": 0.6729,
  "tier": "professional",
  "storage": "redis"
}
```

### Enterprise Additional Metrics

```python
{
  "min_score": 0.5234,
  "max_score": 0.8901,
  "adaptive_weights": True,
  "adjustment_factor": 0.3
}
```

---

## 🧩 Storage Engine Detection

```python
storage = result["metrics"]["storage"]
```

**Values:**
- `redis` → persistent storage
- `memory` → no persistence

---

## 🧩 Best Practice

Always retrieve metrics from the last batch:

```python
metrics = results["metrics"]
```

## 🧬 Enterprise Features

### Adaptive Feature Weighting

- Backend algorithm automatically adjusts feature weights based on data magnitude
- Blends expert-defined weight with learned weight using an `adjustment_factor` (default 0.3)
- Prevents model drift and improves resilience to changing market conditions

---

## 🧱 Scoring Feature Examples

### Traditional (Bureau Data)
`credit_score`, `debt_to_income`, `previous_defaults`, `loan_to_value`, `months_since_last_delinquency`

### Alternative (Thin-File)
`monthly_income`, `employment_months`, `education_level`, `rent_to_income_ratio`, `utility_payment_history`

### Hybrid (Model Outputs)
`internal_risk_score`, `fraud_model_score`

---

## 🤖 Hybrid Model Integration

You can integrate machine learning models or third-party risk systems directly into your scoring pipeline.

### FICO + Internal Model Example

```python
# 1. Load your internal model
risk_model = load_my_internal_model('risk_v2.pkl')

# 2. Define a hybrid configuration
hybrid_config = {
    "fico_score": {"default": 720, "weight": 2.0, "criticality": 2.0},
    "employment_months": {"default": 36, "weight": 1.5, "criticality": 1.0},
    "internal_risk_score": {"default": 0.15, "weight": 2.5, "criticality": 3.0}
}

# 3. Evaluate with hybrid inputs
def evaluate_hybrid_applicant(user_data):
    internal_score = risk_model.predict_proba(user_data)[0][1]
    applicant_context = {
        "fico_score": user_data.get('fico'),
        "employment_months": user_data.get('employment_months'),
        "internal_risk_score": internal_score
    }
    with CreditScoreClient(api_key="...", tier="professional", license_key="...") as client:
        return client.evaluate(applicant_context, hybrid_config)
```

**Benefits of the Hybrid Approach:**
- Configurable Weighting: Balance internal ML models, FICO, and alternative data
- Transparent Decisions: Every score is auditable and explainable
- No Retraining: Adjust model influence dynamically without retraining

## 🧮 Migration from Static Rules

### Before

```python
def legacy_score(applicant):
    score = 500
    if applicant['credit_score'] > 700:
        score += 100
    elif applicant['credit_score'] > 650:
        score += 50
    if applicant['debt_to_income'] < 0.3:
        score += 75
    elif applicant['debt_to_income'] < 0.4:
        score += 25
    if applicant['employment_months'] > 24:
        score += 50
    return score > 650
```

### After

```python
config = {
    "credit_score": {"default": 720, "weight": 2.0, "criticality": 2.0},
    "debt_to_income": {"default": 0.3, "weight": 2.5, "criticality": 2.5},
    "employment_months": {"default": 36, "weight": 1.5, "criticality": 1.0}
}

result = client.evaluate(applicant, config)
print(f"Decision: {result['decision']}")
```
