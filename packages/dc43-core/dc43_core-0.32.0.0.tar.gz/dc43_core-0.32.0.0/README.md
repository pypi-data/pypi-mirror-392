# dc43-core

Shared Python utilities used across the dc43 packages. The helpers in this
package provide light-weight wrappers around the Open Data Contract Standard
(ODCS) and Open Data Product Standard (ODPS) models along with SemVer
manipulation utilities.  They previously lived inside the backend services and
are now published separately so clients, integrations, and services can share a
single implementation.
