This module prints the **Picking Customer Comments** (provided by the
``sale_stock_picking_note`` module) from the **Delivery Address** contact on the invoice
report.
Because this module extends ``sale_stock_picking_note``, please refer to
`that module's README <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/blob/16.0/sale_stock_picking_note/README.rst>`_
to understand the underlying fields and flow.

Use Cases / Context
===================

It's handy to have this default information available in the invoice.
There might be case where there's no delivery slip or it isn't handed to the customer.

Usage
=====

This module assumes you have configured and are using ``sale_stock_picking_note`` as
described in its README (i.e., the **Picking Customer Comments** field is available on
the Contact's *Sales & Purchases* tab and on the Sales Order *Other Information* tab).

**Case 1: Single Sales Order -> Single Invoice**:

#. On the Sales Order, open the *Other Information* tab and set **Picking Customer
   Comments**.
#. When you create and print the invoice from this SO, the invoice report will display
   that **Picking Customer Comments** value from the Sales Order.

**Case 2: Multiple Sales Orders -> One (Grouped) Invoice**:

*When the invoice aggregates two or more sales orders, the report prints one 
value taken from the invoice's Delivery Address (shipping partner).*

#. Create two Sales Orders for the same customer using the same **Delivery Address**.
   Each sales order will have **Picking Customer Comments** set from its **Delivery 
   Address**. You may edit the SO value or leave it as is.
#. Deliver both Sales Orders by validating their related delivery pickings.
#. From the sales order list view, select both Sales Orders and invoice them, grouping
   into a single invoice.
#. Print the grouped invoice; the invoice report will display the **Delivery Address**
   value.

**Notes:**

- Make sure *Settings > Invoicing > Customer Invoices > Customer Addresses* is enabled.
- Changes made directly on pickings are not considered.
