This module prints the **Picking Customer Comments** (provided by the
``sale_stock_picking_note`` module) from the **Delivery Address** contact on the invoice
report.
Because this module extends ``sale_stock_picking_note``, please refer to
`that module's README <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/blob/16.0/sale_stock_picking_note/README.rst>`_
to understand the underlying fields and flow.
