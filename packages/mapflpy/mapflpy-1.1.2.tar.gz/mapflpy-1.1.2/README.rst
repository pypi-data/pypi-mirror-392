mapflpy
=======

Python extension for tracing field lines using the
`MapFL <https://github.com/predsci/MapFL>`_ Fortran tracer.

The goal of **mapflpy** is to provide fast and accurate tracing capabilities for
spherical vector fields inside a convenient Python interface. **mapflpy** is
designed to work natively with the staggered meshes produced by
Predictive Science Inc.'s codes for simulating the solar corona, and 
inner heliosphere (*e.g.* `MAS <https://www.predsci.com/mas>`_ or
`POT3D <https://github.com/predsci/POT3D>`_), but it should be generally compatible
with any global vector field that can be described on a rectilinear grid in 
spherical coordinates.
