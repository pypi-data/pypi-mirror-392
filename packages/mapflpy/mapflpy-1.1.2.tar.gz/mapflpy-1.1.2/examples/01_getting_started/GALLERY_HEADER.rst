Getting Started
===============

The following examples demonstrate how to use the standalone tracing functions provided
in the :mod:`~mapflpy.scripts` module. These functions act as simple wrappers around the
core tracing functionality of the :class:`~mapflpy.tracer.TracerMP` class, allowing users
to perform "one-off" tracing calls without having to manage :class:`~mapflpy.tracer._Tracer`
subclasses.

These examples – and the the corresponding functions in :mod:`~mapflpy.scripts` – are suitable
for most common use cases, and can be used as a starting point for more complex applications.
