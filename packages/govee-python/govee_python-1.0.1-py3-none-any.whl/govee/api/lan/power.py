    Send power command to device via LAN (UDP) and optionally verify.

    Note: Govee devices use a split-port protocol:
    - Commands are sent TO port 4003
    - Responses are received FROM port 4002 (device sends back to client's port)
    - Control commands don't respond, but devStatus queries do

    Args:
        device_ip: Device IP address
        on: True to turn on, False to turn off
        send_port: UDP port to send command to (default: 4003)
        listen_port: UDP port to bind for receiving response (default: 4002)

        verification_delay: Seconds to wait before verifying (default: 0.5s).
                           Set to 0 to disable verification. Increase for slower networks.
