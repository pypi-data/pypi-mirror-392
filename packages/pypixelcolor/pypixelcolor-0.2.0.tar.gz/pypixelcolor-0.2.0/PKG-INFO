`pypixelcolor` (also known as `iPixel-CLI`) is a Python library and CLI tool for controlling iPixel Color LED matrix devices via Bluetooth Low Energy. It allows you to send commands to the device to manipulate the LED display, retrieve device information, and more.

## Features

- Send text, images
- Control animations and effects
- Retrieve device information
- Scriptable via Python

## Usage

### CLI

```bash
python -m pypixelcolor --help
```

### Python Library

```python
import pypixelcolor

client = pypixelcolor.Client("BLE_DEVICE_ADDRESS")
client.connect()
client.send_text("Hello, World!")
client.disconnect()
```

### WebSocket server
