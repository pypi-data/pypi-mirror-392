===================
 Products.mcdutils
===================

The `Products.mcdutils` product supplies a replacement for the ZODB-based
session data container from the `Transience` product, shipped with
the Zope core prior to Zope 4 and available as a separate package after that.
Rather than using a ZODB storage as the backing store for session data, as
`Transience` does, `Products.mcdutils` stores session data in a cluster of
one or more `memcached` servers.

This approach is a bit of a cheat, as it uses the daemons as primary stores,
rather than as caches for results of an expensive query.  Nevertheless, the
semantics are not a bad match for typical session usage.
