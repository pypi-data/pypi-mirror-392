# Euro NCAP Rating 2026

This repository provides tools for calculating Euro NCAP rating scores for 2026. It includes utilities for data conversion, score computation, and visualization of results.

## Installation

Euro NCAP Rating 2026 can be installed using pip.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the package, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher is required. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

#### Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects. 

You only need to create the virtual environment once; after that, simply activate it whenever you work on the project.

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv  # Create once
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate each time
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
python -m venv venv  # Create once
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Activate each time
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m venv venv  # Create once
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Activate each time
```

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can proceed with the installation steps below.

**From PyPi**

The recommended way to install the package is via PyPi, which is the default package index for Python.

To install the package from PyPi or upgrade to the latest version when a new release is available, use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade euroncap-rating-2026
```


**From GitHub repository**

It is also possible to install the package from a local repository or from GitHub, provided you have access to the Git repository.

Ensure you have the following additional prerequisites installed:

- **Git**: Required for installation from the GitHub repository. You can download Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/).

To upgrade to the latest version from the GitHub repository, use:

```bash
pip install --upgrade euroncap_rating_2026@git+https://github.com/Euro-NCAP/euroncap_rating_2026
```


## Usage

The application is organized into two subdomains: **crash_avoidance** and **crash_protection**. Each subdomain provides its own set of commands for generating templates, preprocessing input files, and computing scores.

**General workflow for each subdomain:**

1. Run the `generate_template` command to create the input template for the chosen subdomain.
2. Fill in the required fields in the generated template, following the instructions for each subdomain.
3. Run the `preprocess` command to prepare the data (e.g., generate test points or load cases).
4. Complete any additional required fields in the preprocessed file.
5. Run the `compute_score` command to calculate the results.

### Example: Crash Protection

**Generate the input template:**

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection generate-template
```

This creates a `crash_protection_template.xlsx` file in your current directory.

**Preprocess:**

After filling in the required fields (such as the VRU Prediction Matrix), run:

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection preprocess -i cp_template.xlsx
```

This generates a new file (e.g., `crash_protection_preprocessed.xlsx`) with additional tabs as needed.

**Compute scores:**

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection compute-score -i cp_preprocessed_template.xlsx
```

### Example: Crash Avoidance

**Generate the input template:**

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_avoidance generate-template
```

This creates a `crash_avoidance_template.xlsx` file in your current directory.

**Preprocess:**

After filling in the required fields, run:

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_avoidance preprocess -i ca_template.xlsx
```

This generates a new file (e.g., `crash_avoidance_preprocessed.xlsx`) with additional data as needed.

**Compute scores:**

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_avoidance compute-score -i ca_preprocessed_template.xlsx 
```

### Command-line Help

You can view help for all commands and subcommands:

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 --help
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection --help
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_avoidance --help
```

Each subdomain supports the following subcommands:

- `generate_template` – Generate the input template for the subdomain.
- `preprocess` – Prepare the input file for scoring.
- `compute_score` – Compute scores from the prepared input file.

Example help output:

```bash
euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection --help
usage: euroncap_rating_2026 crash_protection <command> [options]

Sub-commands:
  generate_template   Generate crash protection template file.
  preprocess          Preprocess crash protection input file.
  compute_score       Compute crash protection scores.
```


## Input Format

The application expects the input file to be in `.xlsx` format. 

- **Input Requirements**: Users must provide values for all cells in the template that are highlighted with a **light grey background**. These cells represent the required input data for the application to compute the scores.
- For the VRU test, the user must provide a prediction for each cell in the VRU Prediction Matrix by selecting a color-coded value. Each cell contains a dropdown menu with the available options, which represent the possible prediction outcomes. The selectable values are:

  - **Blue**
  - **Brown**
  - **Dark Red**
  - **Green**
  - **Green-20**
  - **Green-30**
  - **Green-40**
  - **Grey**
  - **Orange**
  - **Red**
  - **Yellow**



## Output Format

The output is an updated `.xlsx` file where all scoring cells are filled with computed scores.

The output file is saved with the naming convention `DATE_TIME_report.xlsx`, where `DATE_TIME` is replaced with the current date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`. For example, an output file generated on March 15, 2026, at 14:30:45 would be named `2026-03-15_14-30-45_report.xlsx`.

This naming convention ensures that each output file is unique and timestamped for easy identification.

- **Output Details**: The cells updated by the application are highlighted with a **yellow background** in the output file, making it easy to identify the computed results.



## Development

### Configuration Options

For development, different configuration options are available. The application can be run in debug mode, which provides additional logging and a GUI for debugging purposes.

The application supports two configuration options:

1. **`log_level`**: Controls the logging level of the application (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).


Configuration options can be specified using environment variables. 

- `EURONCAP_RATING_2026_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level.

You can set the following environment variables before running the application:

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
export EURONCAP_RATING_2026_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
set EURONCAP_RATING_2026_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:EURONCAP_RATING_2026_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```


### Installation from source

To run tests and develop the project, you need to install it from source.

After cloning the repository, install the project using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install
```

After installing from source, the usage is similar to above.

```bash
Usage: euroncap_rating_2026 [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Euro NCAP Rating Calculator 2026 application to compute NCAP scores.

Options:
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  crash_avoidance   Commands for domain crash_avoidance.
  crash_protection  Commands for domain crash_protection.
```

## Tests

### Unit Tests

Unit test can be executed with the command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```


It should output something similar to:

```
....................................................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 68 tests in 0.029s

OK
```

You can check more options for unittest at its [own documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).

### Smoke Test

A Docker-based smoke test suite is included to verify that the application and its dependencies work correctly in a containerized environment. The smoke test automatically generates test input files, runs the main application, and checks for successful execution and output generation.

For details on how to build and run the smoke test, see the [smoke_test/README.md](smoke_test/README.md).
