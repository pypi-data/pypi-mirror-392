# Custom Model

Extend the default dataclass and SQLAlchemy model to capture application-specific metadata (notes, scopes, tags, etc.).

## Overview

- Subclass `ApiKey` to add fields such as `notes` or `scopes`.
- Derive a SQLAlchemy model from `ApiKeyModelMixin` and add new mapped columns.
- Override `SqlAlchemyApiKeyRepository` to translate between the two.

## SQLAlchemy 

This example shows how to add a `notes` field to the domain model and persist it in the database.

!!! warning "Always set a pepper"
    The default pepper is a placeholder. Set `API_KEY_PEPPER` (or pass it explicitly to the hashers) in every environment.

```python
--8<-- "examples/example_sql_custom.py"
```

## FastAPI
This example shows how to add a `notes` field to the domain model and persist it in the database, then expose it over HTTP.

!!! warning "Always set a pepper"
    The default pepper is a placeholder. Set `API_KEY_PEPPER` (or pass it explicitly to the hashers) in every environment.

```python
--8<-- "examples/example_fastapi_custom.py"
```

## Key takeaways

1. The dataclass extends `ApiKey` with a `notes` field.
2. `ApiKeyModel` inherits from `ApiKeyModelMixin` and maps the new column.
3. The repository overrides `to_model` and `to_domain` to keep the new data in sync.

!!! info "Migrations"
    Because you own the SQLAlchemy model, creating migrations with Alembic or your favourite tool is straightforward.
