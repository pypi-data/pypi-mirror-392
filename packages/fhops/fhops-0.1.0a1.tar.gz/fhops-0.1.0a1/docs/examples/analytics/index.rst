Analytics Notebooks
====================

The analytics notebook series demonstrates how to analyse FHOPS playback outputs
for deterministic and stochastic scenarios. Each notebook is executed in the
repository and rendered via ``nbsphinx`` during the documentation build.

.. note::
   Continuous integration runs the notebooks in a "light" configuration by setting
   ``FHOPS_ANALYTICS_LIGHT=1`` before execution. This trims stochastic sample counts so the suite
   completes quickly. Unset the variable when you want the full ensemble baselines locally.
