# Thesis Alignment Plan

Date: 2025-11-07
Status: Draft — ensures FHOPS stays aligned with Rosalia Jaffray’s MASc work.

## Objectives
- Track touchpoints between FHOPS roadmap milestones and thesis deliverables.
- Reference proposal/thesis documents located under `tmp/jaffray-rosalia-*`.
- Document agreed assumptions, scope boundaries, and review cadences.

## Planned Actions
- [ ] Establish regular sync checkpoints (e.g., bi-weekly) to reconcile FHOPS changes with thesis needs.
- [ ] Log key thesis requirements (mobilisation modelling, shift scheduling, synthetic datasets) and map them to FHOPS notes/roadmap phases.
- [ ] Capture dependency notes (e.g., when thesis experiments require specific FHOPS features or datasets).

## Artifacts & References
- `tmp/jaffray-rosalia-masc-proposal`
- `tmp/jaffray-rosalia-masc-thesis`
- FHOPS roadmap (`FHOPS_ROADMAP.md`) and related notes.

## Open Questions
- How to surface thesis-driven deadlines in FHOPS releases?
- Should thesis validation scenarios be formalised as part of the synthetic dataset plan?
