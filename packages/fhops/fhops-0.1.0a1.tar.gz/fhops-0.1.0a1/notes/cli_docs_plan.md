# CLI & Documentation Plan

Date: 2025-??-??
Status: Draft — governs user-facing narrative and tooling upgrades.

## Objectives
- Deliver comprehensive Sphinx documentation (overview, tutorials, API, CLI reference).
- Ensure CLI ergonomics support discoverability (rich help, examples, presets).
- Document mobilisation, harvest systems, and shift scheduling capabilities as they land.
- Align documentation publishing with Read the Docs automation and thesis alignment notes.

## Tasks
- [x] Inventory current CLI commands and options; identify missing help text or examples. *(Covered in CLI reference quick pass; baseline usage documented.)*
- [x] Scaffold Sphinx sections (overview, how-to guides, API reference, CLI reference).
- [ ] Add documentation for modular structure (`notes/modular_reorg_plan.md`) and new feature areas (mobilisation, systems, synthetic datasets).
- [ ] Integrate `sphinx-click` (or equivalent) for automatic CLI docs generation.
- [ ] Prepare RTD configuration and badges; test build locally before enabling remote builds.

## Documentation Deliverables
- [x] Tutorials: quickstart, solver comparison, evaluation workflows. *(Quickstart expanded with minitoy + regression baseline; solver comparison/evaluation remain to-do but tracked in roadmap.)*
- [ ] API modules documented via autodoc/autosummary.
- [ ] CLI reference with command usage and sample invocations.
- [ ] Contribution guide updates referencing planning artefacts.

## Open Questions
- Should we host examples as Jupyter notebooks alongside rendered HTML via nbsphinx?
- How to version documentation in sync with releases vs development snapshots?
