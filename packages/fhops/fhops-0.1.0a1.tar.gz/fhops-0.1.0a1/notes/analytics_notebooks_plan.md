# Analytics Notebook Plan

Date: 2025-11-11
Status: Draft — scaffolding notebooks that surface deterministic and stochastic analytics workflows.

## Objectives
- Provide executed notebooks that demonstrate schedule playback, KPI diagnostics, and what-if analysis.
- Showcase both deterministic and stochastic tooling using lightweight scenarios (minitoy + synthetic bundles).
- Reuse shared plotting/utility code so notebooks stay consistent and easy to maintain.

## Notebook Targets
1. **Playback & KPI Walkthrough (deterministic)**
   - Scenario: `examples/minitoy/scenario.yaml`
   - Story beats:
     - Load scenario + assignments, run deterministic playback.
     - Visualise shift/day tables, highlight key KPI outputs.
     - Introduce basic charts (production vs utilisation), landing/cost snapshots, and CLI parity cells.
2. **Stochastic Robustness Explorer**
   - Scenario: `examples/synthetic/medium/scenario.yaml` (SA assignments from CLI).
   - Story beats:
     - Generate stochastic ensemble using `sampling_config_for`.
     - Plot aggregates (production distribution, weather impact, utilisation bands).
     - Summarise risk metrics (mean/std, quantiles, downtime vs weather components) and deterministic deltas.
3. **What-If Scenario Tweaks**
   - Base: start from mini toy or synthetic medium, adjust parameters inline (e.g., add downtime bias, adjust landing capacity).
   - Compare pre/post KPIs, include interactive parameter toggles, and consolidated comparison tables.
4. **Landing Congestion Analysis**
   - Explore landing shock parameters and throughput impact. *(initial walkthrough scaffolded and executed)*
   - Compare shift/day stats pre/post congestion, chart landing utilisation.
5. **Harvest System Mix Explorer**
   - Showcase system mix presets from synthetic generator. *(scaffolded/executed with baseline vs custom mix comparison)*
   - Analyse machine-role allocation, production contribution, utilisation heatmap.
6. **KPI Decomposition Deep Dive**
   - Break down costs: mobilisation, sequencing, downtime, weather. *(executed deterministic walkthrough added)*
   - Integrate CLI outputs and cross-reference reference docs.
7. **Telemetry & Solver Diagnostics**
   - Run `fhops solve-heur --telemetry-log`, parse JSONL for objective/acceptance trends. *(sample telemetry log ingested and plotted)*
   - Visualise operator stats and runtime evolution.
8. **Ensemble Resilience Comparison**
   - Compare multiple stochastic tiers (small/medium/large). *(notebook executed with mean/std comparisons)*
   - Compute risk metrics, show production/downtime distributions side-by-side.
9. **Operator/Benchmark Sweep**
   - Parameterise `fhops bench suite` with multiple presets. *(notebook executes suite with preset comparisons)*
  - Summarise objective/runtime comparisons, visualise solver performance. *(objective/runtime pivot tables added)*
10. **Benchmark Summary Notebook**
    - Load benchmark CSV outputs across scenarios. *(CSV generated and notebook summarises objectives/runtimes)*
    - Chart solver categories, KPIs, and scaling behaviour.

## Shared Utilities
- Module: `docs/examples/analytics/utils.py` *(implemented)*
  - `load_playback_tables(scenario_path, assignments_path)`
  - `run_stochastic_summary(scenario_path, assignments_path, sampling_config)`
  - Chart helpers (`plot_production_series`, `plot_utilisation_heatmap`, `plot_distribution`).
- Plot stack: prefer Altair for interactive views (fallback to matplotlib for static fallback).
- Output cache: store derived CSV/JSON under `docs/_build/analytics/` to keep notebooks lightweight when re-running.
- Future improvement: expand notebooks with deeper CLI tie-ins/interactive controls and ensure Altair/Jupyter double-rendering is addressed in a follow-up pass.

## Execution & Automation
- Place notebooks under `docs/examples/analytics/`:
- `playback_walkthrough.ipynb`
- `stochastic_robustness.ipynb`
- `what_if_analysis.ipynb`
- Store deterministic/stochastic assignment CSVs under `docs/examples/analytics/data/` for reproducible runs.
- [x] Flesh out notebooks with narrative walkthroughs and executed outputs (scenario overview, KPIs, plots).
- [x] Provide `scripts/run_analytics_notebooks.py` to execute notebooks via `nbconvert` with metadata capture.
- [x] CI smoke target: execute notebooks with reduced sampling counts (configurable via environment variables).

## Documentation Integration
- Use `nbsphinx` to render notebooks within Sphinx (`docs/examples/analytics/index.rst`). ✅
- Update `docs/index.rst` “Examples” to include the analytics notebooks. ✅
- Mention notebooks in `README.md` and `docs/howto/evaluation.rst` for discoverability. *(todo)*

## Open Questions
- Do we expand the what-if notebook to include solver reruns, or keep it playback-only for now?
- Decide whether to bundle pre-rendered images when runtime is high (fallback to cached HTML exports?).

## Next Actions
- [x] Scaffold utilities module (`docs/examples/analytics/utils.py`) and add minimal plotting helpers.
- [x] Create empty notebooks with headers/storyboard cells.
- [x] Wire `nbsphinx` / documentation index to anticipate the new notebooks.
- [x] Prepare reduced sampling config for CI smoke execution (`FHOPS_ANALYTICS_LIGHT` env flag).
- [x] Update `README.md` and docs landing pages with links to the analytics notebook suite and execution guidance.
- [x] Investigate lighter-weight caching or execution guards if notebook runtime grows (consider storing rendered HTML in future).
  - [x] Profile current runtimes in full (non-light) mode and document thresholds that would trigger caching.
  - [x] Prototype/decision: caching deferred — current runs complete <6s; no cache directory added (capture in backlog if future regressions appear).
  - [x] Runner guard rails noted (`FHOPS_ANALYTICS_LIGHT`) removes need for additional force-refresh toggle today.

### Runtime snapshot (2025-11-11 full mode)
- playback_walkthrough: 4.18s
- stochastic_robustness: 4.28s
- what_if_analysis: 4.13s
- landing_congestion: 4.93s
- system_mix: 3.93s
- kpi_decomposition: 4.38s
- telemetry_diagnostics: 4.08s
- ensemble_resilience: 5.13s
- operator_sweep: 4.18s
- benchmark_summary: 3.93s

*Observation*: even with full stochastic settings, each notebook completes in <6s on dev hardware, so caching remains optional. Revisit caching only if CI runtime regresses.

## Outcome (2025-11-11)
- CI runs light-mode notebooks; full-mode runtimes documented.
- README/docs advertise the suite and light flag.
- Caching deferred (backlog item if runtimes exceed ~10s per notebook or CI pressure increases).
