# Architecture Implementation Plan

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All implementation tasks have been completed.

> **Note**: This document is kept for historical reference. The architecture migration described here has been completed. For current architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md](../architecture/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md).

## Summary

This document described the implementation plan for migrating from the initial codebase to the current architecture. All phases have been completed:

- ✅ **Phase 1**: CrewAI moved to extensions (was `features/`, now `extensions/`)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Dependencies updated (CrewAI in optional extras)
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Imports updated (all references updated)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: `ext/` renamed to `examples/` (later removed, test cases serve as examples)
- ✅ **Phase 5**: All references updated

## Current Architecture

The current architecture matches the design described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md):

- **Core**: `core/` - Pure orchestration framework
- **Extensions**: `extensions/` - Framework extensions (crewai, stdio)
- **API**: `api/` - A2A Protocol Server
- **CLI**: `cli/` - CLI tools
- **Test cases**: Serve as examples (see `tests/integration/` and `tests/extensions/`)

## Key Changes Completed

1. ✅ Unified extension system with `ExtensionRegistry` and Protocol-based design
2. ✅ Directory renamed from `features/` to `extensions/`
3. ✅ All documentation updated to reflect current structure
4. ✅ Circular import issues resolved via Protocol-based architecture
5. ✅ Extension registration system implemented with `@extension_register` decorator

## For Current Development

- **Architecture**: See [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Directory Structure**: See [DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md](../architecture/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md)
- **Extension System**: See [EXTENSION_REGISTRY_DESIGN.md](../architecture/EXTENSION_REGISTRY_DESIGN.md)
- **Development Guide**: See [DEVELOPMENT.md](../development/DEVELOPMENT.md)
