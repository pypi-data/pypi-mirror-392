### Installation

#### Option 1: Install via pip (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

```bash
pip install hatiyar
```

Then run:

```bash
hatiyar              # Launch interactive shell
hatiyar shell        # Same as above
python -m hatiyar    # Alternative way to run
```

```bash
make info
```

##### 4. Run the Framework

```bash
make shell           # Interactive shell
make serve           # Web server (coming soon)
```
