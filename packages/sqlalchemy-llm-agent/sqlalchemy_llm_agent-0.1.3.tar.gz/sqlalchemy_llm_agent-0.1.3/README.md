# SQLAlchemy LLM Agent

`sqlalchemy-llm-agent` packages a small, batteries-included LangChain agent that can inspect
SQLAlchemy schemas and run ad-hoc SQL queries generated by an LLM. It is helpful when you want
to whether work within cli or build quick administrative panel.

## Features
- **Only read operations** - Gives agent only to use safe sqlqueries.
- **Config-driven access control** – restrict the agent to a whitelist of tables by name or give
  it access to every table in the database via the special `"*"` entry.

## Installation
```
pip install sqlalchemy-llm-agent
```

## Quickstart
Below is a minimal end-to-end example that shows how to configure and call the agent. This
example assumes you already have a SQLAlchemy `Engine` and have run `inspect(engine)` to
produce an inspector object.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from sqlalchemy_llm_agent import SqlalchemyAgent, SqlalchemyAgentConfig

engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb")
inspector = inspect(engine)

config = SqlalchemyAgentConfig(
    api_key="sk-openai-123",  # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
    model="gpt-5",            # Optional, defaults to gpt-5
    tables=["users", "orders"],  # Limit the agent to just these tables or ["*"]
    row_limit=100,
    inspector=inspector,
    engine=engine,
)

agent = SqlalchemyAgent(config)
result_rows = agent.query("List the five most recent orders including user email")
for row in result_rows:
    print(row)
```

The agent will automatically:
1. Inspect the `users` and `orders` tables to learn their columns.
2. Generate a SQL query using the configured LLM (`gpt-5` by default).
3. Execute the query through your SQLAlchemy engine and return the results as a list of
   dictionaries.

You now have a reusable component that can power chatbots, dashboards, or internal tools that
need natural-language access to relational data.

## Command-line usage
You can also run ad-hoc queries directly from a terminal with the bundled CLI. Create a Python
config file that exposes a `sqlalchemy_llm_agent_config` variable:

```python
# config.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, inspect
from sqlalchemy_llm_agent import SqlalchemyAgentConfig

engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb")
inspector = inspect(engine)

sqlalchemy_llm_agent_config = SqlalchemyAgentConfig(
    api_key="sk-openai-123",
    tables=["payments"],
    inspector=inspector,
    engine=engine,
)
```

Then invoke the CLI by pointing it to the config file and passing the natural-language query:

```
sqlalchemy_llm_agent --config ./config.py "Give me success payments"
```

The command prints the resulting rows as formatted JSON, making it easy to script around or
inspect responses interactively.
