      can then be stored and emailed as a single entity. A NetworkLink can fetch a
      KMZ file from a web server. When the KMZ file is unzipped, the main .kml file
      and its supporting files are separated into their original formats and directory
      structure, with their original filenames and extensions. In addition to being
      an archive format, the Zip format is also compressed, so an archive can include
      only a single large KML file. Depending on the content of the KML file, this
      process typically results in 10:1 compression. Your 10 Kbyte KML file can be

    en: PDF – Portable Document Format – is a file format developed to present documents,
      including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application
      software, hardware and operating systems. Based on the PostScript language,
      each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document,
      including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information
      needed to display it. PDF was standardized as an open format and does not require
      any royalties for its implementation.

      structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship between things as
      well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a ‘triple’).
      Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be
      mixed, exposed and shared across different applications. This linking structure
      forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between
      two resources, represented by the graph nodes.

      graphics images, popular among graphic artists, the publishing industry and
      photographers. TIFF is widely supported by scanning, faxing, word processing,
      optical character recognition, image manipulation, desktop publishing and page-layout
      applications. The format was created by Aldus Corporation for use in desktop
      publishing.
