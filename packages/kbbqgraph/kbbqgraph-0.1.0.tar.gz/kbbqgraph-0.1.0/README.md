<h1>KBBQGraph - Barebones and Quick for k-partite graphs</h1>

This is a WIP for a memory-efficient replacement for NetworkX for a specific application.

I work with k-partite graphs when matching datasets, where each dataset is a partite. Most immediately, I need to handle 100s of partites each with 10,000's of nodes, and ~5,000 directed edges connecting each partite set. This quickly saturates NetworkX.

I also need efficient indexing based on partite number and feature number -- this is not offered by any other graphing library.

Someday, I would like to add some very specific homegrown k-partite clustering algorithms. These also assume one-to-one constraints when compressed to undirected, i.e. at most a node _u_ from partite _i_ can only be connected to one node from partite _j_.

```python
import networkx as nx
from kbbqgraph import KBBQGraph

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a new graph
# ------------------------------------------------------------
g = KBBQGraph(isDiGraph=0, preAllocate=10, name="example")

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Add nodes
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Add nodes to “dataset/partite 0”
g.add_nodes(0, [0, 1, 2])

# Add nodes to “dataset/partite 1”
g.add_nodes(1, [0, 1])

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Add edges (batched)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Each node is a (dataset, id) tuple, i.e. (partite, local_index)
source_nodes = [
    (0, 0),  # node 0 in dataset 0
    (0, 2),  # node 2 in dataset 0
]

target_nodes = [
    (1, 1),  # node 1 in dataset 1
    (1, 0),  # node 0 in dataset 1
]

weights = [1.0, 0.5]  # optional; can also pass None

g.add_edges(
    source_nodes=source_nodes,
    target_nodes=target_nodes,
    weights=weights,
    check_duplicates=True,
)

print("Nodes:", g.num_nodes)
print("Edges:", g.num_edges)

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Convert to NetworkX
# ------------------------------------------------------------
nx_graph = g.to_networkx()

print("NetworkX edges (u, v, data):")
for u, v, data in nx_graph.edges(data=True):
    print(u, "→", v, "weight=", data.get("weight"))
