"""Placeholder runtime helper for the passive buzzer DSL primitive.

The runtime intentionally performs no action—the transpiler replaces calls to
this helper with Arduino code—but providing a small amount of documentation
helps users understand the surface area that *is* recognised during
transpilation.

Supported built-in melodies
===========================

The :meth:`Buzzer.melody` helper accepts the following melody names, mirroring
the emitter's bundled patterns.  Each name is case-sensitive.

``"success"``
    A quick, rising triad cue suitable for acknowledgement tones.
``"error"``
    A short descending blip that resolves to a low hold.
``"startup"``
    A C–E–G–C arpeggio, ideal for power-on or reset notifications.
``"notify"``
    A short double ping to highlight lightweight notifications.
``"alarm"``
    Alternating high/low notes that repeat eight times for urgency.
``"scale_c"``
    An ascending C-major scale resolving to the upper tonic.
``"siren"``
    A repeating two-note pattern that evokes a classic siren sweep.
