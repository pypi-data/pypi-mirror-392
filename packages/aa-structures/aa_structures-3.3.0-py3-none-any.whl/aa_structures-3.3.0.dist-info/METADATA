## Overview

This app is for managing Eve Online structures with [Alliance Auth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth). It allows all member corporations to see a current list of all their structures in Auth. In addition it allows forwarding Eve Online notifications to Discord.

## Features

Structures adds the following main features to Alliance Auth:

- Structure browser with a detailed list of all structures owned by member corporations, automatically synced with the game server
- Structures include all Upwell structures, Custom Offices and Starbases / POSes
- Automatically forwards Eve Online notifications to Discord channels as alerts for these categories:
  - Upwell structures
  - Customs offices
  - Starbases
  - Moon mining
  - Sovereignty
  - Wars
  - Corporation membership changes
- Automatically adds timers from relevant notifications to [Alliance Auth Structure Timers](https://allianceauth.readthedocs.io/en/v2.8.1/features/apps/timerboard.html) or [Structure Timers II](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-structuretimers) app (if installed)
- Fittings, contents of Upwell structures (e.g. fuel blocks and ammo) and current fuel usage
- Additional structure notifications generated by the app:
  - Configurable alerts to warn about fuel running at in structures and POSes, and which can replace the ESI notifications
  - Notifications to inform when structures have been refueled (BETA)
  - Configurable alerts to warn about jump fuel (liquid ozone) running low in jump gates
  - POS reinforced (BETA)
- Tax rates and access settings of Customs Offices
