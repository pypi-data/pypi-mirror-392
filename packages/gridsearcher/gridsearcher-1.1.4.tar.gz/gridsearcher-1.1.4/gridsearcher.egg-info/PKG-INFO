                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# GridSearcher 𖣯🔍

---

GridSearcher is a pure Python project designed to simplify the process of running grid searches for Machine Learning 
projects. It serves as a robust alternative to traditional bash scripts, providing a more flexible and user-friendly 
way to manage and execute multiple programs in parallel. 

⚠️ **It is designed for systems where users have direct SSH access 
to machines and can run their python scripts right away.**

# Features ✨󠁇󠁇󠁇
- **Grid Search Made Easy:** Define parameter grids effortlessly and the cartesian product of your hyper-parameters 
will be computed automatically and an instance of your script will be run for all possible combinations.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run multiple programs concurrently, maximizing your computational resources.
- **GPU Scheduling:** Built-in GPU allocation ensures efficient use of available GPUs. Specify the number of GPUs and 
jobs per GPU, and **GridSearcher** will handle the rest
- **Flexible Configuration:** Easily control the number of parallel jobs and GPU assignments through a scheduling 
dictionary.
- **Pure Python:** No more dealing with complex bash scripts. **GridSearcher** is written entirely in Python, making it 
easy to integrate into your existing Python workflows.

# Why GridSearcher? 🤔
- **User-Friendly:** Simplifies the setup and execution of grid searches, allowing you to focus on your Machine 
Learning models.
- **Efficient Resource Management:** Optimize the use of your GPUs and computational resources.
- **Pythonic Approach:** Seamlessly integrates with your Python projects and leverages Python's rich ecosystem.
- **Direct SSH Access:** Ideal for systems where users have direct SSH access to machines, providing a straightforward 
setup and execution process without the need for SLURM or other workload managers, ensuring a smooth and efficient operation.

# SBATCH wrapper for SLURM (NEW in version 1.0.4)
We also added a wrapper for SBATCH that allows running SLURM jobs directly from Python!

```python
SBATCH(
    script='script.sh', # the shell script that will be launched using sbatch
    env_vars=dict( # these variables will be set in the --export argument of sbatch and will be available in the h100-eval.sh script
        root=ROOT,
        wandb_project=wandb_project,
        wandb_group=wandb_group,
        wandb_job_type=wandb_job_type,
        wandb_name=wandb_name,
        task='imagenet',
        batch_size=128,
    ),
    sbatch_args={ # the variables below will be added to the sbatch command (e.g. --job_name)
        'exclude': 'machine-1,machine-2',
        'job-name': f'job-name',
        'error': 'slurm_output/%j-%x.err',
        'output': 'slurm_output/%j-%x.out',
        'ntasks': 1,
        'cpus-per-task': 20,
        'time': '1-00:00:00',
        'mem': '200G',
        'partition': 'gpu',
        'gres': 'gpu:H100:1',
    }
).run()
```

# Versions history:
- **1.1.4** @ 2025-11-14:
  - return commands when `debug=True`, which is useful to combine with `SBATCH` on a cluster that can exclusively be used via SLURM
- **1.1.3** @ 2025-11-13:
  - introduced `SchedulingConfig` and `TorchRunConfig` to control `rdzv` parameters and `MASTER_ADDR/PORT` for `torchrun`
- **1.1.2** @ 2025-01-23:
  - added `create_state_finished` parameter to control whether the process writes the file `state.finished` when returns with error code 0 or not
- **1.1.1**: fixed import issues
- **1.1.0**: removed specific arguments and replaced them with dictionaries to offer flexibility to use any SBATCH params
- **1.0.4**: added SBATCH class, which can be used in a completely separated manner from GridSearcher, allowing running slurm jobs from python
- **1.0.3**: do not check whether the script ends with `.py` extension anymore
- **1.0.2**: checking the return code of `os.system` and create file `state.finished` only if `code == 0`
- **1.0.1**: added assert statement to make sure that all values in the `scheduling["params_values"]` are of type list
- **1.0.0**: added initial project
