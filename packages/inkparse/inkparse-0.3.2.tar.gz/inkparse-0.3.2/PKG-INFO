# inkparse

This is an utility library for making hand written recursive descent parsers.

It is very early in development, so expect breaking changes.

Usage is somewhat verbose, and I'm not happy with it yet. I'll probably rewrite a lot of it before further development.

# Usage

(See the `inkparse.general` module for general purpose parsers you can use as examples. The classes also have some docstrings.)

Defining parsers:
```
def foo(si: StringIterator, ...) -> Result[int, Literal["token_type"]] | ParseFailure:
    with si() as c:
        si.literal("abc")
        # etc.
        return c.result(10, "token_type")       # success
        return c.fail("Fail reason here.")      # fail
        raise c.error("Error reason here.")     # error
```

Using parsers:
```
si = StringIterator("blablabla")

result = foo(si)
if result:
    ... # `result` is a `Result` or `Token` object
else:
    ... # `result` is a `ParseFailure` object

x = result.unwrap().data    # raises an error if x is a `ParseFailure`
```

String positions are *between* characters and start from 0. (The same as how python string slices work.)

In the string: `"abcdef"`
```
 a b c d e f
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

(Line numbers and column numbers shown in error messages start from 1 instead of 0.)
