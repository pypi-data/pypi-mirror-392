This module adds the concept of "Condition" to lot so that this
information can be indicated (for example: Good or Defects).

Usage
=====

You can define the conditions in the Inventory > Configuration >
Products > Lot conditions menu.

Default conditions are not defined because they depend on the type of
company:

1. Classification by Grade (A, B, C) This system is common in
   refurbished products (electronics) and second-hand clothing.

- Grade A (Excellent/Like new): The item is in perfect working
  condition. It may have very slight signs of use or none at all. In the
  case of clothing, there are no noticeable stains or damage.
- Grade B (Good/Very Good/Fair): The item functions perfectly, but shows
  visible signs of normal use, such as minor scratches, slight dents, or
  cosmetic wear.
- Grade C (Acceptable/Sufficient): The item is fully functional but has
  more obvious cosmetic flaws, such as dents, deep scratches, or
  significant wear. Clothing may have stains or loose stitching.

2. Condition Descriptions (Sales Platforms) Platforms such as Amazon use
   a descriptive system so that buyers have clear expectations:

- As new: The item is intact and works perfectly, but the packaging may
  be damaged.
- Very good: Minimal use, with minor cosmetic signs.
- Good: Works perfectly, but with visible wear from normal use.
- Acceptable: May have cosmetic imperfections, scratches, dents, etc.,
  but is still functional.

3. For Specific Parts (e.g. Automotive) In the spare parts sector,
   classification is often based on origin and warranty:

- Used part: Removed from another vehicle as is, its condition may vary
  and usually requires the customer's approval of its condition.
- Refurbished/remanufactured part: The part has been restored to its
  original specifications or to a condition very close to new, offering
  guarantees similar to a new part.
