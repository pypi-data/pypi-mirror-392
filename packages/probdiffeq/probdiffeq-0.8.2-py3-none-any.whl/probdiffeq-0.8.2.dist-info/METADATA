## Probabilistic ODE solvers in JAX

**Probdiffeq** implements adaptive probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It builds on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), thus inheriting **automatic differentiation**, **vectorisation**, and **GPU acceleration**.

## Features

- ⚡ Calibration and step-size adaptation  
- ⚡ Stable implementations of filtering, smoothing, and other estimation strategies  
- ⚡ Custom information operators, dense output, and posterior sampling  
- ⚡ State-space model factorisations  
- ⚡ Parameter estimation
- ⚡ Taylor-series estimation with and without Jets  
- ⚡ Seamless interoperability with [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [BlackJAX](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/), and other JAX-based libraries  
- ⚡ Numerous tutorials (basic and advanced) -- see the [documentation](https://pnkraemer.github.io/probdiffeq/)  

---

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install probdiffeq
```

> This assumes [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is already installed.  

To install with JAX (CPU backend):  

```bash
pip install probdiffeq[cpu]
```

⚠️ **Note:** This is an active research project. Expect rough edges and breaking API changes.

---

## Benchmarks

We maintain benchmarks comparing **Probdiffeq** against other solvers and libraries, including [SciPy](https://scipy.org/), [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Diffrax](https://docs.kidger.site/diffrax/).

Run benchmarks locally:

```bash
pip install .[example,test]
make benchmarks-run
```
