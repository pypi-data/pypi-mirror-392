        The licensor grants you a copyright license for the
        software to do everything you might do with the software

        License](#changes-and-new-works-license).
        
        ## Distribution License
        
        The licensor grants you an additional copyright license
        to distribute copies of the software.  Your license
        to distribute covers distributing the software with

        License](#changes-and-new-works-license).
        
        ## Notices
        
        You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of
        the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the
        URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines
        beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided
        with the software.  For example:

        permitted purpose.
        
        ## Patent License
        
        The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that
        covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able
        to license, that you would infringe by using the software.
        
        ## Noncommercial Purposes
        
        Any noncommercial purpose is a permitted purpose.
        
        ## Personal Uses
        
        Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for
        the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private

        is use for a permitted purpose.
        
        ## Noncommercial Organizations
        
        Use by any charitable organization, educational institution,
        public research organization, public safety or health
        organization, environmental protection organization,
        or government institution is use for a permitted purpose
        regardless of the source of funding or obligations resulting
        from the funding.
        
        ## Fair Use
        
        You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
        law. These terms do not limit them.
        
        ## No Other Rights
        
        These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
        your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
        granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply
        any other licenses.
        
        ## Patent Defense
        
        If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
        contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
        for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
        your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends
        immediately for work on behalf of your company.
        
        ## Violations
        
        The first time you are notified in writing that you have
        violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
        not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless
        continue if you come into full compliance with these terms,
        and take practical steps to correct past violations, within
        32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
        end immediately.
        
        ## No Liability
        
        ***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without
        any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable
        to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use
        or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

# Nexroo CLI

> **📚 Full Documentation:** https://docs.nexroo.ai

CLI wrapper for Nexroo workflow engine with authentication and package management.

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.11+** is required for addon packages to work. The engine itself is a standalone binary, but addons are installed to your system Python.

- **Windows:** [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Linux:** `apt install python3` or `yum install python3`
- **macOS:** `brew install python3`

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# install CLI
pip install nexroo-cli
# use CLI to install engine
nexroo install
```

or

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexroo-ai/nexroo-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexroo-ai/nexroo-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```


## Quick Start

After installation, authenticate and run your first workflow:

```bash
# Authenticate with Synvex
nexroo login

# Run a workflow
nexroo run workflow.json
```

## Usage

### Authentication Commands

#### Login
```bash
nexroo login
```

Opens browser for Zitadel authentication. Credentials stored encrypted for 30 days.

#### Logout
```bash
nexroo logout
```

Clears saved credentials.

#### Status
```bash
nexroo status
```

Shows authentication status and token expiration.

### Running Workflows

**With authentication** (SaaS features enabled):
```bash
nexroo run workflow.json [entrypoint]
```

**Without authentication** (local-only mode):
```bash
nexroo run workflow.json --no-auth
```

### Additional Options

```bash
nexroo run workflow.json [entrypoint] [options]
```

Refer to [Nexroo Documentation](https://docs.nexroo.ai) for all available options.

### Update

```bash
pip install --upgrade nexroo-cli
nexroo update
```

### Uninstall

```bash
# Uninstall engine, addons, and all data
nexroo uninstall

# Remove the CLI package
pip uninstall nexroo-cli
```

## Addon Packages

### Installing Addons

Addons extend the engine with additional capabilities (AI providers, databases, storage, etc.).

```bash
# Install an addon
nexroo install redis

# List available addons
nexroo addon list --available

# List installed addons
nexroo addon list
```

### Troubleshooting Addon Issues

**If the engine can't find an addon:**

1. Verify Python 3.11+ is installed:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. Check addon installation:
   ```bash
   nexroo addon list
   python3 -m pip list | grep rooms-pkg
   ```

3. Reinstall addon:
   ```bash
   nexroo addon install <package> --upgrade
   ```

## Storage Locations

- Engine binary: `~/.nexroo/bin/nexroo-engine`
- Addon packages: System Python's site-packages
- Encrypted tokens: `~/.nexroo/auth_token.enc`
- Encryption key: `~/.nexroo/.key`
- Addon metadata: `~/.nexroo/installed_packages.json`

## Troubleshooting

For debug use '--verbose'

### Authentication fails
```bash
nexroo logout
nexroo login
```

### Token expired
```bash
nexroo status
nexroo login   # Re-authenticate
```
